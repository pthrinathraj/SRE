# 1.1.7 EC2 Hibernate - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is EC2 Hibernate?
**EC2 Hibernate** enables you to pause and resume your Amazon EC2 instance, preserving the in-memory state. The contents of the RAM are stored on the root EBS volume, allowing the instance to resume exactly where it left off.

## 2. Key Features
- Preserves application state across stop/start cycles
- Fast instance startup after hibernation
- Avoids reinitialization of application setup
- Only charges for EBS and storage when stopped

## 3. Requirements and Limitations
- EBS-backed instance with an encrypted root volume
- Supported instance types and AMIs only
- RAM limit based on root volume size
- Hibernate duration: up to 60 days

## 4. Use Cases
- Long-running simulations
- Development environments
- Preserving in-memory session data

## 5. How It Works
- On hibernation: RAM is saved to the root EBS
- On resume: RAM is restored and applications pick up from the saved state

## 6. How to Enable
- Use AWS Console or CLI (`--hibernation-options Configured=true`)
- Select "Enable hibernation" during EC2 launch

## 7. Costs
- No EC2 compute charges while stopped
- EBS storage costs continue for the root volume

## 8. CLI Example
```bash
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-xxxx
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-xxxx --hibernate
```
