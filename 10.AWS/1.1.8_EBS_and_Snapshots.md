# 1.1.8 Amazon EBS and Snapshots - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is Amazon EBS?
**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** provides persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2. EBS volumes act like hard drives and can be attached to EC2 instances.

## 2. Types of EBS Volumes
- **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)**: Balanced for most workloads
- **io2/io2 Block Express (Provisioned IOPS SSD)**: High performance for I/O intensive workloads
- **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)**: Big data and streaming workloads
- **sc1 (Cold HDD)**: Infrequent access data
- **Magnetic (deprecated)**

## 3. Key Features
- Persistent across reboots and terminations (if not deleted)
- Can be resized or changed type without downtime
- Can be encrypted
- Snapshots can be created for backups and DR

## 4. Snapshots
- **EBS Snapshots** are incremental backups stored in Amazon S3.
- Only changes from the previous snapshot are saved.
- Snapshots are used to restore volumes or create new ones.

## 5. Use Cases
- Database storage
- File systems
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Boot volumes

## 6. Backup Best Practices
- Use lifecycle policies to automate snapshot creation/deletion
- Tag snapshots for easy identification
- Store snapshots in another region for DR

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Throughput and IOPS vary by volume type
- Multi-attach is available for io1/io2 volumes
- Pre-warming not required for gp3/gp2, needed for restored volumes

## 8. CLI Examples
```bash
# Create volume
aws ec2 create-volume --size 20 --volume-type gp3 --availability-zone us-east-1a

# Create snapshot
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-xxxx --description "Backup"

# Restore from snapshot
aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id snap-xxxx --availability-zone us-east-1a
```
