# 1.1.a EC2 User Data - Detailed Guide

## 1. Introduction to EC2 User Data
EC2 User Data is a feature that allows you to run a script automatically when an EC2 instance is launched. The script runs once during the instance's boot process and can be used to configure the instance, install software, or execute other initialization tasks.

User Data is especially useful for automating instance setup, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring consistency across instances.

## 2. Key Features of EC2 User Data
- **Automation**: Automate tasks like installing software, configuring settings, or running scripts when the instance starts.
- **Supports Bash and PowerShell**: User Data can run scripts written in **Bash** (Linux instances) or **PowerShell** (Windows instances).
- **Execution at Boot**: The script is executed when the instance is launched or rebooted (if not terminated).
- **Cloud-Init**: For Linux-based instances, Cloud-init is used to perform more advanced configuration during startup.

## 3. Supported Formats for EC2 User Data
- **Linux (Bash scripts)**: Typically used for package installation, service configuration, or any system-level task.
- **Windows (PowerShell scripts)**: Used for similar configuration tasks as Bash scripts, but specifically for Windows environments.
- **Cloud-init**: A more flexible tool for Linux instances, allowing advanced configurations.

## 4. How to Add User Data to an EC2 Instance

### 4.1 During EC2 Instance Launch
- Go to the **Launch Instance** wizard in the AWS Management Console.
- Under **Advanced Details**, find the **User Data** section.
- Paste the desired script (Bash for Linux or PowerShell for Windows) into the User Data box.

### 4.2 Using AWS CLI
You can specify User Data via the AWS CLI using the `--user-data` parameter:
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --user-data file://setup_script.sh

5. Examples of EC2 User Data Scripts
5.1 Linux (Bash script to install Apache)
#!/bin/bash
# Install Apache HTTP Server
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hello, World!" > /var/www/html/index.html

This script will:

Update the package list (yum update -y).

Install Apache HTTP Server (yum install -y httpd).

Start Apache (systemctl start httpd).

Ensure Apache starts on boot (systemctl enable httpd).

Create a simple index.html page (echo "Hello, World!" > /var/www/html/index.html).

6. Retrieving EC2 User Data
6.1 For Linux Instances
You can retrieve the User Data script from within the instance by running:
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

7. Troubleshooting User Data
7.1 Common Issues
Permissions: Ensure the EC2 instance has the necessary IAM roles and permissions for executing tasks within the User Data script.

Errors in Script Execution: If the script fails, check the instance's system logs or view CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting.

7.2 Cloud-init Logs
For Linux instances using Cloud-init, logs are available at:

bash
/var/log/cloud-init.log

8. Use Cases for EC2 User Data
Automated Application Deployment: Automatically deploy applications when EC2 instances are launched.

Configuration Management: Configure servers, such as setting up firewall rules, users, and other services.

Environment Setup: Set up development, staging, or production environments without manual intervention.
