# 4.1.1 RDS Read Replicas and Replication Options – Detailed Guide

## 1. What Are RDS Read Replicas?
**Read Replicas** in Amazon RDS allow you to create read-only copies of your database. They are used to:
- Offload read traffic from the primary database
- Improve read scalability
- Enable disaster recovery across AZs or regions
- Support migration and cross-region deployment strategies

Replication is **asynchronous**, meaning changes to the source DB are propagated with a slight delay.

## 2. Key Characteristics
- Serve read-only traffic (e.g., analytics, reports)
- Can be promoted to standalone DB instances
- Can replicate to the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region
- Replication lag is visible via CloudWatch
- Supported by: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Aurora

## 3. Replication Options

| Option            | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Within AZ**     | Source and replica are in the same Availability Zone              |
| **Cross-AZ**      | Replica is in a different AZ within the same region               |
| **Cross-Region**  | Replica is in a different region (e.g., us-east-1 to eu-west-1)   |

## 4. Multi-AZ vs Read Replicas

| Feature              | Multi-AZ                          | Read Replica                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Replication Type     | Synchronous                       | Asynchronous                        |
| Use Case             | High availability & failover      | Read scaling, disaster recovery     |
| Standby Readable     | ❌ No                             | ✅ Yes                               |
| Failover             | ✅ Automatic                       | ❌ Manual                            |
| Engine Support       | All RDS engines                   | Varies                              |

## 5. Cross-Region Read Replicas
Cross-region replicas are useful for:
- DR strategy across geographies
- Reducing latency for globally distributed users
- Migrating to a new AWS region

Note: Replication lag may be higher due to inter-region latency.

## 6. Steps to Create a Read Replica

### AWS CLI
```bash
aws rds create-db-instance-read-replica \
    --db-instance-identifier mydb-replica \
    --source-db-instance-identifier mydb \
    --region us-west-2
```

Supports cross-AZ and cross-region deployment.

## 7. Promoting a Read Replica
To convert a replica into a standalone DB instance:

```bash
aws rds promote-read-replica --db-instance-identifier mydb-replica
```

Used during failover or regional migration.

## 8. Convert Single-AZ to Multi-AZ

### AWS Console
1. Navigate to the RDS instance.
2. Choose “Modify”.
3. Change **Multi-AZ Deployment** to "Yes".
4. Apply immediately or during maintenance.

### AWS CLI
```bash
aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydb \
    --multi-az \
    --apply-immediately
```

## 9. Monitoring Read Replicas

Use **CloudWatch metrics**:
- `ReplicaLag`
- `CPUUtilization`
- `FreeStorageSpace`
- `ReadIOPS`

Set alarms to detect performance issues early.

## 10. Best Practices
- Route heavy read queries to replicas to offload primary DB.
- Use **cross-region replicas** for disaster recovery and global reach.
- Monitor **replication lag** regularly.
- Use **automatic failover (Multi-AZ)** for HA.
- Promote read replicas when scaling independently.
