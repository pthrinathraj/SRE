# 4.2.1 Amazon Aurora: Replicas, Auto Scaling, Endpoints, Global DB, Serverless, and AI/ML Integrations

## 1. Aurora Replicas

Aurora supports up to **15 Aurora Replicas** per cluster. These are **read-only** nodes that share the same distributed storage as the primary instance.

### Key Benefits:
- **Millisecond replication lag**
- **Automatic failover** to a replica during failure
- **Load balancing** across read traffic

You can route read traffic to replicas using **Aurora Reader Endpoints**.

---

## 2. Aurora Auto Scaling

Aurora supports **Auto Scaling of Replicas** to dynamically adjust the number of read replicas based on:
- CPU utilization
- Active connections
- Custom CloudWatch metrics

### How It Works:
1. Define minimum and maximum replica count.
2. Configure scaling policy tied to CloudWatch alarms.
3. Aurora scales replicas in/out as needed.

```bash
aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
  --service-namespace rds \
  --resource-id cluster:mydbcluster \
  --scalable-dimension rds:cluster:ReadReplicaCount \
  --min-capacity 1 --max-capacity 15
```

## 3. Aurora Endpoints

Aurora offers **custom endpoints** to simplify DB access and traffic routing.

| Endpoint Type     | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster Endpoint** | Connects to primary instance (read/write)   |
| **Reader Endpoint**  | Load balances across all replicas (read-only)|
| **Custom Endpoint**  | Connects to a specific set of instances      |

Custom endpoints are great for:
- Grouping replicas for analytical workloads
- Segmenting traffic for isolated app modules

---

## 4. Aurora Global Database

Aurora Global Database is built for **cross-region replication and DR**.

### Features:
- Replicates data with ~1 second latency
- 1 primary + up to 5 read-only secondary regions
- Manual or planned failover for disaster recovery
- Suitable for global apps (e.g., fintech, gaming)

### Use Cases:
- Multi-region read scalability
- Disaster Recovery (DR)
- Regional application deployments

---

## 5. Aurora Serverless

Aurora offers **Serverless v1 and v2**, ideal for unpredictable or intermittent workloads.

### Serverless v1
- Uses **ACUs (Aurora Capacity Units)**
- Cold start time ~30s
- Good for dev/test workloads

### Serverless v2
- Instant, fine-grained scaling
- **Multi-AZ**, **production-grade**
- Fully compatible with features like Global DB and IAM auth

### Example Use Cases:
- Spiky web applications
- Scheduled batch jobs
- Event-driven architectures (integrated with Lambda)

---

## 6. AI/ML Integrations with Aurora

Aurora integrates with **Amazon SageMaker**, **Comprehend**, and **ML inference endpoints** using **SQL functions**:

### Built-in ML Capabilities:
- Use SQL to invoke SageMaker models:
```sql
SELECT aws_sagemaker.invoke_endpoint('my-model', input_column)
FROM my_table;
```

- Sentiment analysis, entity recognition via Amazon Comprehend:
```sql
SELECT aws_comprehend.detect_sentiment(text_column, 'en') FROM feedback;
```

### Benefits:
- No need to move data out of Aurora
- Real-time predictions directly from SQL
- Scalable, secure, and serverless

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use **Reader Endpoints** to distribute read traffic
- Enable **auto scaling** for replicas to optimize cost/performance
- Implement **Global DB** for cross-region DR
- Choose **Serverless v2** for scalable workloads
- Integrate with **ML models via SQL** to reduce ETL latency
