# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Detailed Guide

## 1. Introduction to EC2
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a foundational compute service in AWS that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 offers a variety of instance types, including virtual machines and containers, which can be provisioned to run any application or workload. It is designed for flexibility, scalability, and reliability, helping users run their workloads on demand while optimizing costs and performance.

Key Benefits:
- **Scalable**: Scale your compute resources based on workload requirements with automatic scaling.
- **Flexible**: Choose the instance type and configuration that best suits your needs.
- **Cost-effective**: Only pay for the instances you use and opt for various pricing models.
- **Secure**: Leverage EC2's built-in security features, including security groups, IAM, and more.

## 2. Core Components of EC2

### 2.1 EC2 Instances
An **EC2 instance** is a virtual server that runs applications in AWS. Instances can be configured with various combinations of CPU, RAM, storage, and networking capacity based on your workload requirements. Instances are grouped into different families based on specific use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and more.

### 2.2 Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
**Amazon EBS** provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances. EBS volumes can be attached to EC2 instances to store data, and the data will persist even if the instance is stopped or terminated.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Persistent storage**: Data remains intact even after EC2 instance stops or restarts.
  - **Volume Types**: Choose between different volume types for performance and cost optimization (e.g., SSD or HDD).
  - **Snapshots**: Create backups of EBS volumes using snapshots.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Store operating system data, application data, or database files.

### 2.3 Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
An **instance store** is temporary storage that is physically attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. This storage is useful for temporary data but is **lost** when the instance is stopped or terminated.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Ephemeral**: Data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
  - **High Performance**: Instance stores offer high I/O performance for short-term data.

- **Use Cases**:
  - High-performance workloads that require temporary data storage (e.g., caching, buffer data).

### 2.4 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a pre-configured template that contains the OS, application stack, and configurations required to launch an EC2 instance.

- **Creating an AMI from EC2**: You can create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance by selecting the instance and using the **Create Image** option in the AWS Console.
- **How AMIs are Used**: AMIs allow you to replicate EC2 instances quickly, ensuring a consistent configuration across multiple instances.

### 2.5 Elastic IP (EIP)
An **Elastic IP** is a static IPv4 address that can be associated with EC2 instances. Unlike public IPs, which change when an EC2 instance is stopped and restarted, an EIP remains persistent.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Persistent**: Unlike dynamic IP addresses, Elastic IPs remain unchanged when instances are stopped and restarted.
  - **Elastic**: You can reassign the EIP to different EC2 instances as needed.

### 2.6 EC2 Instance Lifecycle and Behavior

When you stop and restart an EC2 instance, the following behaviors occur:

- **Public IP Address**: The public IP assigned to an EC2 instance **changes** when you stop and start it, unless you associate an **Elastic IP**. Elastic IPs do not change and can be mapped to different EC2 instances.
- **Instance Store Data**: Any data stored on instance store volumes (ephemeral storage) is **lost** when the instance is stopped or terminated. However, **EBS data is preserved**.
- **Private IP Address**: The **private IP** remains the same across stops and starts.
- **EBS Volumes**: EBS volumes persist even if the EC2 instance is stopped, but they are detached if the instance is terminated.

### 2.7 Security Groups
**Security Groups** are virtual firewalls used to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Stateful**: Security groups automatically allow outbound traffic in response to inbound traffic.
  - **Inbound and Outbound Rules**: Define rules to control which traffic can reach your instance (e.g., ports, IP addresses).
  - **Multiple Security Groups**: You can assign multiple security groups to an EC2 instance.

### 2.8 Key Pairs
Key pairs are used for secure SSH access to Linux-based EC2 instances or RDP access for Windows-based EC2 instances.

- **How It Works**:
  - A **public key** is stored in AWS, and the corresponding **private key** is stored securely by you.
  - Use the private key to authenticate and access EC2 instances securely.

### 2.9 Instance Metadata and User Data
**Instance Metadata** refers to information about the EC2 instance, such as instance ID, region, AMI ID, and more. **User Data** is a script that runs automatically when an instance is launched, typically used for initial configuration or software installation.

- **Instance Metadata**: Can be accessed from within the instance by querying the metadata URL.
- **User Data**: Can be used to automate the configuration of the instance at startup (e.g., installing software, configuring settings).

## 3. EC2 Pricing Models

Amazon EC2 provides several pricing options, including:

- **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second without any long-term commitments.
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to using EC2 for 1 or 3 years to receive a discount.
- **Spot Instances**: Purchase unused EC2 capacity at a reduced rate, with the possibility of instance termination.
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing model offering discounts for committing to specific usage patterns over a 1- or 3-year term.

## 4. Best Practices

- **Choose the Right Instance Type**: Select instances based on workload requirements (compute, memory, storage).
- **Security**: Always use IAM roles to provide the least privilege, and restrict access using Security Groups.
- **Cost Optimization**: Use **Spot Instances** and **Auto Scaling** to optimize costs and resource allocation.
- **Monitoring**: Use **CloudWatch** to monitor instance health, performance, and set up alarms for proactive action.

## 5. Common Use Cases

- **Web Hosting**: EC2 is commonly used for hosting web applications and websites with varying traffic demands.
- **Big Data Processing**: High-performance EC2 instances can be used for running distributed data processing frameworks like Hadoop or Spark.
- **Business Applications**: EC2 is ideal for running business-critical applications that require reliable and scalable infrastructure.
- **Batch Processing**: EC2 is often used for running large-scale, parallel batch jobs requiring compute-intensive resources.

## 6. EC2 Instance Lifecycle

- **Launch**: Choose AMI, instance type, security groups, and storage configuration.
- **Stop**: The instance is stopped, and EC2 charges for EBS storage but not compute resources.
- **Start**: The instance restarts and retains EBS data. Public IP changes unless an Elastic IP is associated.
- **Terminate**: The instance is permanently deleted, and instance store data is lost. EBS volumes are detached, and data is preserved unless configured to delete.
