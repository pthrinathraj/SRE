# 1.1.9 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is an AMI?
An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a **template** that contains the information required to launch an EC2 instance. This includes:
- A preconfigured **OS** (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows)
- **Application server**, **libraries**, and **custom software**
- Instance **volume configurations** (root + data volumes)
- Launch permissions and metadata

AMIs are fundamental to automating EC2 instance launches and scaling application environments.

## 2. Components of an AMI
- **Root Volume Template**: OS and software configuration
- **Launch Permissions**: Controls who can launch instances from the AMI
- **Block Device Mapping**: Info about volumes to attach (size, type, encryption)

## 3. Types of AMIs
- **Public AMIs**: Provided by AWS or shared publicly (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu)
- **Private AMIs**: Created by you or shared within your AWS account
- **Marketplace AMIs**: Provided by third-party vendors via AWS Marketplace

## 4. Why Use Custom AMIs?
- **Consistency**: Launch identical environments across dev, test, and prod
- **Faster Launches**: Skip lengthy install/config steps by pre-baking software
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly restore instances to a known state
- **Scaling**: Spin up autoscaling groups using prebuilt golden images

## 5. How to Create an AMI
You can create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance.

### AWS Console
1. Select your EC2 instance.
2. Click **Actions > Image and templates > Create Image**.
3. Provide a name, description, and select volume settings.
4. AWS creates the AMI and registers it.

### AWS CLI
```bash
aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-xxxxxx --name "MyAppImage" --no-reboot
```

- `--no-reboot`: Optional flag to prevent reboot before AMI creation.

## 6. Launching Instances from AMI
Once created, an AMI can be used to launch new instances:
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --instance-type t2.micro --key-name mykey
```

## 7. Copying AMIs
You can **copy an AMI** across regions for DR or geographical distribution.
```bash
aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id ami-xxxxx --source-region us-east-1 --region us-west-1 --name "MyAMI-west"
```

## 8. Deleting AMIs
Deleting an AMI does **not** delete associated snapshots.
```bash
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx
```

To delete the snapshots:
```bash
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-xxxxxxxx
```

## 9. Best Practices
- **Tag your AMIs** for versioning and environment (e.g., `Env=Prod`, `App=Web`).
- **Encrypt root volumes** of AMIs using KMS.
- Use **Packer** or **EC2 Image Builder** for automated AMI pipelines.
- Clean up unused AMIs and snapshots to save storage costs.

## 10. Tools for AMI Creation
- **Packer**: Popular open-source tool for automating AMI builds.
- **EC2 Image Builder**: AWS service for pipeline-based image management.
