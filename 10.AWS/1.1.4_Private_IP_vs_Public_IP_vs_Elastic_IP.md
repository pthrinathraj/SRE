# 1.1.4 Private IP vs Public IP vs Elastic IP - Detailed Guide

## 1. Introduction to Private IP, Public IP, and Elastic IP
In AWS, **Private IP**, **Public IP**, and **Elastic IP** serve different purposes in managing and accessing **EC2 instances** and network resources.

- **Private IP**: Used for internal communication within a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** or local network.
- **Public IP**: Used to make EC2 instances accessible from the internet.
- **Elastic IP**: A static, persistent public IP that can be re-assigned to different EC2 instances.

## 2. Private IP Address
A **Private IP address** is used for internal communication within a VPC or local network. These IP addresses are **not routed over the internet** and can only be accessed from within the same network. They are essential for communication between instances in a private subnet or within a VPC.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Assigned to EC2 instances in private subnets.
  - Cannot be accessed from the internet directly.
  - Typically falls within the IP ranges defined by **RFC 1918**: `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`, `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`, `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`.
  - Used for internal applications, databases, and other back-end services.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Instances that need to communicate with each other in a private network (e.g., database servers, internal services).
  - Applications that donâ€™t require internet access.

## 3. Public IP Address
A **Public IP address** is used to make your EC2 instance accessible from the **internet**. This IP address is dynamically assigned to instances that are launched in a **public subnet** within a VPC.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Assigned to instances in a public subnet.
  - Routable over the internet.
  - Changes when the instance is stopped and started again, unless an **Elastic IP** is assigned.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Instances that need to be directly accessible from the internet (e.g., web servers, APIs).
  - Applications that require access to external resources or services.

## 4. Elastic IP Address (EIP)
An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a static, persistent **IPv4** address designed for dynamic cloud computing. Elastic IPs allow you to maintain a fixed public IP address for your EC2 instance, even when the instance is stopped and started again.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Static**: Elastic IPs do not change when the EC2 instance is stopped and started again.
  - **Reassignable**: You can associate an Elastic IP with any EC2 instance in the same region, making it easy to switch traffic between instances without changing the IP address.
  - **Billing**: Elastic IPs are free when associated with a running instance but incur a cost if they are not associated with a running instance.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Applications requiring a **static** public IP address (e.g., DNS configurations).
  - Failover and high availability configurations, where an Elastic IP can be reassigned to another instance quickly in case of failure.

## 5. Limitations of Elastic IPs
1. **Costs When Unused**: Elastic IPs incur charges if not associated with a running instance. This is done to prevent idle IPs from being reserved indefinitely.
2. **Limited Availability**: AWS limits the number of Elastic IPs per region (typically **five**). You can request more, but additional EIPs are not always guaranteed.
3. **Reassignments**: Frequent reassignments of Elastic IPs between instances may impact performance, as switching traffic requires propagation across the network.
4. **Not Always Necessary**: For many applications, a **regular public IP** or using **load balancers** may suffice. Elastic IPs are generally only needed for applications requiring a static, persistent IP.

## 6. Why Use Elastic IP?
### **When Elastic IP Should Be Used**:
- **Persistence**: If your application requires a fixed public IP that stays the same even when the instance is stopped and started, Elastic IP is the solution.
- **Failover and High Availability**: Elastic IPs are ideal for high availability scenarios. In case of a failure, you can quickly reassign an Elastic IP to another instance, minimizing downtime.
- **DNS or External Services**: When your DNS records or external services need a static IP address that does not change, an Elastic IP provides the necessary stability.

### **Why Elastic IP Should NOT Be Used**:
- **Cost**: Elastic IPs are charged when not in use. For temporary or development use cases, a regular public IP may be sufficient.
- **Limited Number**: AWS restricts the number of Elastic IPs you can use, making it impractical for large-scale applications that require many IPs.
- **Overuse**: Using Elastic IPs as a substitute for regular public IP addresses where persistent IPs are not needed could lead to unnecessary complexity and cost.
