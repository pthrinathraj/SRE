# 3.1 Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) – Core Concepts

## 1. What is Amazon VPC?

**Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** allows you to launch AWS resources in a **logically isolated network** you define. It's the foundation of AWS networking, offering full control over:
- IP addressing (CIDR)
- Subnets
- Routing
- Firewall rules
- Internet/VPN access

## 2. Key Components of a VPC

| Component             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CIDR Block**         | Defines the IP address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)                            |
| **Subnets**            | Segments of the VPC used to isolate workloads                              |
| **Route Tables**       | Rules that control routing of traffic within the VPC                       |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Allows communication with the public internet                          |
| **NAT Gateway**        | Enables internet access for private subnets                                |
| **Elastic IPs**        | Static, public IPs for persistent routing                                  |
| **Security Groups**    | Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances                                        |
| **Network ACLs (NACLs)** | Stateless firewalls for subnets                                         |
| **DHCP Options Set**   | Configures DNS resolution for the VPC                                      |
| **VPC Peering/Transit Gateway** | Enables VPC-to-VPC or multi-VPC communication                    |

## 3. Default vs Custom VPC

| Feature              | Default VPC                            | Custom VPC                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Created by AWS       | ✅ Yes                                  | ❌ No – you define it                   |
| Subnets              | 1 public subnet per AZ                 | You define public/private subnets      |
| Internet Gateway     | Attached                                | Must be created manually               |
| CIDR Range           | 172.31.0.0/16 (default)                | Custom defined                         |

## 4. VPC Addressing

- CIDR block: Can range from /16 to /28 (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
- VPCs support **IPv4** and **IPv6**
- You can **associate secondary CIDRs** for expansion

---

## 5. Subnets

- **Public subnet**: Route to Internet Gateway
- **Private subnet**: No direct internet route (can use NAT)
- **Isolated subnet**: No internet access, not even outbound

---

## 6. Routing in a VPC

Each subnet is associated with a **route table**:
- Controls destination IP ranges and where traffic is forwarded
- One subnet can only be linked to one route table at a time

---

## 7. VPC Peering and Transit Gateway

| Option               | Purpose                              | Notes                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **VPC Peering**      | Connect two VPCs                     | No transitive routing, regional            |
| **Transit Gateway**  | Hub-and-spoke connection for 1000s of VPCs | Supports transitive routing, better for scale |

---

## 8. High Availability with VPC

- Deploy subnets across **multiple Availability Zones**
- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** and **Load Balancers**
- Design **public/private subnet models** for security and scalability

---

## 9. Logging & Monitoring

- **VPC Flow Logs**: Track network traffic for diagnostics
- **CloudTrail**: Logs changes to VPC configurations
- **AWS Config**: Compliance with VPC setup and security posture

---

## 10. Best Practices

- Use **multiple AZs** for HA design
- Design **segmented subnets** for isolation (app tier, DB tier, etc.)
- Use **NAT Gateway + private subnets** for secure backend access
- Limit usage of default VPC for production workloads
- Monitor VPC traffic using **VPC Flow Logs**
