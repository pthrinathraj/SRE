# 3.3 Internet Gateway (IGW) and Route Tables – AWS Networking

## 1. What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)?

An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available **VPC component** that allows **communication between instances in your VPC and the internet**.

It enables:
- **Outbound traffic** to the internet
- **Inbound traffic** from the internet (when allowed by Security Groups)

---

## 2. What is a Route Table?

A **Route Table** is a set of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Each **subnet** must be associated with exactly **one route table**.

---

## 3. IGW + Route Table: How It Works

To enable internet access:
1. Create and attach an **Internet Gateway** to your VPC.
2. Create or update a **Route Table** with a default route:
   ```
   Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
   Target: igw-xxxxxxxx (Internet Gateway)
   ```
3. Associate the route table with a **public subnet**.
4. Ensure the instance has a **public or Elastic IP**.
5. Update **Security Groups** to allow incoming/outgoing traffic.

## 4. Route Table Example

| Destination     | Target         | Description                       |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 10.0.0.0/16     | local          | Internal VPC traffic              |
| 0.0.0.0/0       | igw-abc12345   | Route for internet access         |

---

## 5. Public vs Private Subnet Routing

| Subnet Type     | Route to IGW | Route to NAT | Internet Access     |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Public           | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        | ✅ Inbound & Outbound |
| Private          | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Outbound Only      |
| Isolated         | ❌ No        | ❌ No        | ❌ None              |

---

## 6. AWS CLI – IGW and Route Table Setup

```bash
# Create and attach IGW
aws ec2 create-internet-gateway
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id igw-xxxxx --vpc-id vpc-xxxxx

# Create route table
aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-xxxxx

# Add route to IGW
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-xxxxx --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id igw-xxxxx

# Associate route table with subnet
aws ec2 associate-route-table --subnet-id subnet-xxxxx --route-table-id rtb-xxxxx
```

---

## 7. Security Considerations

- Route Table does not enforce security – use **Security Groups** and **NACLs**
- Only subnets with both:
  - Public IP (or EIP)
  - Route to IGW  
  ...are **public subnets**

---

## 8. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Use **VPC Flow Logs** to inspect traffic
- Use **Reachability Analyzer** in VPC for diagnosing routing
- Use **CloudTrail** to monitor changes to IGW and route tables

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Separate route tables for public and private subnets
- Always validate that public routes use the correct **IGW**
- Minimize use of 0.0.0.0/0 in **private** routes
- Use **tags** for clear route table and IGW identification
