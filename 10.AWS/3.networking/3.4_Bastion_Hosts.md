# 3.4 Bastion Hosts – AWS Networking

## 1. What is a Bastion Host?

A **Bastion Host** (also known as a jump box) is a special-purpose EC2 instance that acts as a **secure gateway** for administrative access (SSH or RDP) to **private instances** in a VPC.

It is:
- Placed in a **public subnet**
- Secured with **strict Security Group and IAM policies**
- Used to **avoid exposing private instances** directly to the internet

## 2. Bastion Host Architecture

```
Internet
   |
[ Bastion Host ]  <-- Public Subnet + Elastic IP
   |
[ Private Subnet ]
   |
[ EC2, RDS, etc. ]
```

- Admins connect to the Bastion Host first
- Then hop into internal/private instances via SSH

---

## 3. Bastion Host Setup – Step-by-Step

1. Launch an EC2 instance (e.g., Amazon Linux) in a **public subnet**
2. Attach an **Elastic IP (EIP)**
3. Configure **Security Group**:
   - Allow SSH (port 22) from trusted IPs only
4. Configure internal EC2 instances:
   - Private subnet, no public IP
   - Security Group allowing SSH from **bastion host SG**
5. Use SSH agent forwarding for secure credentials management

## 4. Security Best Practices

| Practice                                | Description                                               |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Restrict SSH access                  | Use IP whitelisting (CIDR blocks)                        |
| 🔐 Use Key Pairs or Session Manager     | Avoid hardcoded credentials                              |
| 🧱 Add Firewall Rules                   | Security Group → allow SSH only from Bastion Host         |
| 👤 IAM Policies                         | Least privilege principle                                |
| 🛑 Monitor Logs                         | Enable **CloudTrail** and **VPC Flow Logs**              |
| 🔁 Rotate Keys Frequently               | Revoke and replace key pairs regularly                   |

## 5. Alternatives to Bastion Host

| Alternative         | Description                                                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** | Connect to instances without opening SSH ports or using bastions |
| **AWS Client VPN**  | Provide secure remote access to AWS VPC                           |
| **EC2 Instance Connect** | Temporary key-based access through the AWS console           |

---

## 6. Bastion Host Automation

- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** and **Launch Templates** for high availability
- Use **AWS Systems Manager Agent** (SSM) for patching and updates
- Automate login restrictions via **AWS IAM policies**

---

## 7. Monitoring and Auditing

- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** to inspect inbound/outbound traffic
- Log user commands via **CloudWatch Logs Agent**
- Audit access with **CloudTrail** and **AWS Config**

---

## 8. Cost Considerations

- Bastion Host is a regular EC2 instance
- Minimal cost with:
  - **t3.micro** in free tier eligible accounts
  - **Spot instances** if appropriate for short sessions

---

## 9. Summary

| Feature                | Bastion Host                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Placement              | Public Subnet                      |
| Role                   | SSH/RDP jump point into VPC        |
| Alternatives           | Session Manager, VPN, EC2 Connect  |
| Key Security Focus     | Restrict inbound rules, logging     |
