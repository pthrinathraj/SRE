# 3.11 VPC Traffic Mirroring – AWS Networking

## 1. What is VPC Traffic Mirroring?

**VPC Traffic Mirroring** enables you to capture and inspect network traffic from **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** attached to EC2 instances.

It’s used for:
- Deep packet inspection
- Threat monitoring
- Performance analysis
- Compliance auditing

---

## 2. Key Components

| Component            | Description                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mirror Source**     | The ENI (EC2 instance) whose traffic you want to capture          |
| **Mirror Target**     | The destination (ENI, Network Load Balancer, etc.) where mirrored traffic is sent |
| **Mirror Filter**     | Defines which traffic to capture (e.g., ports, protocols)         |
| **Mirror Session**    | Binds the source, target, and filter together                     |

---

## 3. Use Cases

- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
- **Real-time packet-level traffic analysis**
- **Security forensics and compliance**
- **Troubleshooting and debugging network issues**

---

## 4. How It Works

Traffic Mirroring copies packets from the source ENI and forwards them to the target in real time:

```
[ EC2 Source (ENI) ] --> [ Mirror Filter ] --> [ Mirror Target (e.g., monitoring appliance) ]
```

Traffic remains within your **VPC** or **AWS Region**. You can use a **NLB** as a scalable target for third-party tools.

---

## 5. Mirror Filter Rules

You can filter traffic by:
- **Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)**
- **Source/destination CIDR**
- **Port range**

This allows **fine-grained control** of what is captured and reduces noise.

---

## 6. Creating Traffic Mirroring (CLI)

```bash
# Step 1: Create Mirror Target
aws ec2 create-traffic-mirror-target \
  --network-interface-id eni-xxxxxx \
  --description "My Target"

# Step 2: Create Mirror Filter
aws ec2 create-traffic-mirror-filter

# Step 3: Create Mirror Session
aws ec2 create-traffic-mirror-session \
  --network-interface-id eni-source \
  --traffic-mirror-target-id tmt-xxxxxx \
  --traffic-mirror-filter-id tmf-xxxxxx \
  --session-number 1
```

---

## 7. Cost Considerations

- Charged per **GB of mirrored traffic**
- Includes **data processing + network traffic to target**
- Monitor usage to avoid surprises

---

## 8. Limitations

| Feature                 | Limitation                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ENI types supported     | EC2 primary and secondary ENIs only             |
| Cross-region mirroring  | ❌ Not supported                                |
| Target ENI type         | Must be in the **same AZ** as the source        |
| Max sessions per ENI    | Varies by instance type (check AWS limits)      |

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Use **filters** to minimize unnecessary traffic
- Centralize analysis with a **monitoring appliance or NLB**
- Deploy in **test environments** before production rollout
- Monitor logs with **CloudWatch and VPC Flow Logs**
