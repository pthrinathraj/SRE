# 3.9 VPC Flow Logs – AWS Networking

## 1. What are VPC Flow Logs?

**VPC Flow Logs** capture **network traffic metadata** for **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** in a VPC. This includes information about **accepted and rejected traffic** and helps with:
- Security auditing
- Troubleshooting
- Network monitoring

VPC Flow Logs do **not capture packet payloads** — only metadata about the traffic.

---

## 2. Where Can You Enable Flow Logs?

You can enable flow logs at three levels:
| Level              | Scope                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **VPC level**      | Captures logs for all ENIs in the VPC |
| **Subnet level**   | Captures logs for all ENIs in a subnet |
| **Network Interface (ENI)** | Captures logs for a specific ENI  |

---

## 3. Log Destinations

You can send flow logs to:
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
- **Amazon S3**

---

## 4. VPC Flow Log Record Format

Each log record includes:
```
version account-id interface-id srcaddr dstaddr srcport dstport protocol packets bytes start end action log-status
```

| Field         | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| srcaddr       | Source IP address                            |
| dstaddr       | Destination IP address                       |
| action        | ACCEPT or REJECT                             |
| log-status    | OK, NODATA, SKIPDATA                         |
| bytes         | Number of bytes transferred                  |
| packets       | Number of packets                            |

## 5. Example Use Cases

- Identify **blocked connections** or **denied security group rules**
- Monitor **unusual traffic spikes**
- Audit **internal and external communications**
- Analyze **data transfer trends** for cost optimization

---

## 6. Creating Flow Logs (CLI)

```bash
aws ec2 create-flow-logs \
  --resource-type VPC \
  --resource-ids vpc-xxxxxx \
  --traffic-type ALL \
  --log-destination-type cloud-watch-logs \
  --log-group-name vpc-flow-logs \
  --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/flow-logs-role
```

---

## 7. Filtering and Aggregation (Advanced Features)

- **Custom log formats** to include specific fields
- **Log filtering** (e.g., only REJECTs or only TCP)
- **Aggregation interval**: 1-minute or 10-minute options

---

## 8. Costs

- Billed for data ingestion into **CloudWatch** or **S3**
- Additional charges for **CloudWatch Insights queries**

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Enable flow logs in **production VPCs** for visibility
- Use **filters** to reduce log volume (e.g., REJECT only)
- Export logs to **S3** for long-term analysis and Athena queries
- Use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for real-time queries
- Store flow logs securely with **encryption and access control**

---

## 10. Security & Compliance

- Helps meet **compliance requirements** (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- Integrates with **AWS Security Hub** and **Amazon GuardDuty**
