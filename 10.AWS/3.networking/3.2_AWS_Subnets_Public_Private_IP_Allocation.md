# 3.2 AWS Subnets – Public, Private, and IP Addressing

## 1. What is a Subnet?

A **subnet** is a range of IP addresses within a VPC. Subnets help you **segment your VPC** to isolate workloads (e.g., web tier vs database tier) and apply different routing and security policies.

Each subnet must:
- Belong to **only one Availability Zone**
- Be associated with a **route table**

---

## 2. Public vs Private Subnets

| Type           | Description                                                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public**     | Routes traffic to the internet via **Internet Gateway (IGW)**           |
| **Private**    | Has **no direct route to the internet**; usually uses **NAT Gateway**   |
| **Isolated**   | No internet access (inbound or outbound)                                |

> Subnet type is determined by **route table entries**, not a property of the subnet itself.

---

## 3. How Subnets Are Created

- You specify a **CIDR block** (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`)
- AWS reserves **5 IP addresses per subnet**

---

## 4. Reserved IP Addresses in Every Subnet

| IP               | Purpose                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| `x.x.x.0`        | Network address                  |
| `x.x.x.1`        | Reserved for VPC router          |
| `x.x.x.2`        | Reserved for DNS server          |
| `x.x.x.3`        | Reserved for future use          |
| `x.x.x.255`      | Network broadcast address        |

> ❗ These 5 addresses are **unusable** for EC2 or other resources.

---

## 5. Usable IPs by CIDR Block

| CIDR Block | Total IPs | Reserved | Usable IPs |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| /28        | 16        | 5        | 11          |
| /27        | 32        | 5        | 27          |
| /26        | 64        | 5        | 59          |
| /24        | 256       | 5        | 251         |
| /20        | 4096      | 5        | 4091        |
| /16        | 65536     | 5        | 65531       |

Use this to calculate how many resources you can place in each subnet.

## 6. Subnet Design Best Practices

- Create **public subnets** for:
  - Load balancers
  - Bastion hosts
  - NAT Gateways

- Create **private subnets** for:
  - Application servers
  - Databases
  - Internal APIs

- Use **smaller CIDRs (/28)** for:
  - NAT Gateways
  - VPC endpoints
  - Highly isolated components

- Tag subnets clearly (e.g., `env:prod`, `type:public`)

- Always distribute subnets across **multiple AZs** for high availability

---

## 7. Tools for Planning Subnets

- AWS VPC Subnet Calculator (via console)
- Online tools: [CIDR.xyz](https://cidr.xyz/)
- `ipcalc` (Linux CLI)
- Terraform modules for subnet planning

---

## 8. Subnet Routing Logic

- Public subnet: Must have a route to **Internet Gateway**
- Private subnet: Uses **NAT Gateway or NAT instance**
- Isolated subnet: Has **no internet route at all**

---

## 9. Visual Example

```
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  ├── Public Subnet (10.0.0.0/24) → IGW
  ├── Private Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) → NAT Gateway
  └── Isolated Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) → Internal-only
```
