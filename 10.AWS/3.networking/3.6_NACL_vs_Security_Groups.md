# 3.6 NACL vs Security Groups – AWS Networking

## 1. Introduction

In AWS, two primary tools provide **network-layer security controls** for your resources:

- **Security Groups (SG)** – Operate at the **instance level**
- **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)** – Operate at the **subnet level**

---

## 2. Security Groups (SG)

### What Are They?

Security Groups are **stateful virtual firewalls** that control **inbound and outbound traffic** at the EC2 instance level.

### Key Features:
- **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed
- Applied directly to **EC2, RDS, ENI**
- Supports **only allow rules** (no deny)
- Evaluated as a **whitelist**

### Default SG Configuration:
| Direction | Rule                |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Inbound   | Deny all            |
| Outbound  | Allow all traffic   |

---

## 3. Network ACLs (NACL)

### What Are They?

NACLs are **stateless firewall rules** applied at the subnet level. They evaluate **both inbound and outbound rules explicitly**.

### Key Features:
- **Stateless**: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed
- Operate at the **subnet boundary**
- Support both **allow and deny** rules
- Evaluated in **numerical rule order** (lowest first)

### Default NACL Configuration:
| Direction | Rule     | Action  |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Inbound   | Allow all| ALLOW   |
| Outbound  | Allow all| ALLOW   |

> ⚠️ Default NACL is permissive. Custom NACLs deny all until rules are added.

## 4. Comparison: Security Group vs NACL

| Feature                     | Security Group                      | Network ACL                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Level of Operation          | Instance-level (ENI)                | Subnet-level                           |
| Stateful/Stateless          | ✅ Stateful                          | ❌ Stateless                           |
| Allow/Deny Rules            | Only Allow                          | Allow and Deny                         |
| Default Inbound Behavior    | Deny                                | Allow (default NACL)                   |
| Default Outbound Behavior   | Allow                               | Allow (default NACL)                   |
| Rule Evaluation Order       | All rules evaluated                 | Evaluated by rule number               |
| Associated With             | EC2, RDS, Lambda (VPC mode)         | Subnets                                |
| Rule Types                  | IP/Port/Protocol                    | IP/Port/Protocol                       |

---

## 5. Use Cases

| Use Case                         | Recommended Tool     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Control access to EC2 directly   | Security Group        |
| Subnet-wide blacklist/deny list | NACL                  |
| Allow all HTTPS traffic to subnet| NACL + SG combo       |
| Different rules per instance     | Security Group        |

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use **SGs as the primary access control mechanism**
- Keep **NACLs simple** (deny suspicious IPs at subnet level)
- Never rely solely on default NACL – define explicit rules
- Group similar resources with same security policies using **SGs**
- Always **test connectivity** after applying changes

---

## 7. Monitoring & Auditing

- Use **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor accepted/denied traffic
- Track configuration changes via **CloudTrail**
- Use **AWS Config Rules** for compliance enforcement
