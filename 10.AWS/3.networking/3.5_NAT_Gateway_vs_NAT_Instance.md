# 3.5 NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance – AWS Networking

## 1. What is NAT?

**NAT (Network Address Translation)** allows instances in a **private subnet** to initiate outbound internet connections (e.g., downloading patches, accessing APIs) **without being directly accessible from the internet**.

## 2. NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance

| Feature                | NAT Gateway                          | NAT Instance                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Managed by AWS         | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No – must manage yourself          |
| High Availability      | ✅ Built-in, multi-AZ                 | ❌ Manual setup required              |
| Bandwidth Scaling      | ✅ Automatically scales               | ❌ Limited to EC2 instance size       |
| Security Updates       | ✅ Handled by AWS                     | ❌ Manual patching required           |
| Logging Support        | ✅ VPC Flow Logs                      | ❌ Must configure manually            |
| Failover               | ✅ Automatic                          | ❌ Custom scripts needed              |
| Cost                   | Slightly higher but managed          | Lower cost but more effort            |
| Elastic IP             | ✅ Required                           | ✅ Optional                           |

> ⚠️ **NAT Instances are considered legacy** and are deprecated in favor of NAT Gateways for production.

## 3. Internet Traffic Workflow

### a. From **Internet → Private Subnet**
- ❌ Not allowed (blocked by default)
- Private instances do **not accept inbound connections from the internet**
- No route from IGW to private subnet

### b. From **Private Subnet → Internet**
1. EC2 instance sends traffic to the route table's **default gateway** (`0.0.0.0/0`)
2. Route points to the **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet
3. NAT Gateway **translates private IP to Elastic IP**
4. Response from the internet is routed back via **NAT Gateway**, which forwards to the **correct private IP**

---

## 4. Does Each Private Instance Need a NAT Gateway?

> ❌ **No.**

You do **not** need one NAT Gateway per instance. You only need **one NAT Gateway per AZ** for high availability and cost efficiency.

### Example:

| AZ        | Private Subnet | NAT Gateway                     |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| us-east-1a| 10.0.1.0/24     | NAT Gateway in 10.0.0.0/24      |
| us-east-1b| 10.0.2.0/24     | NAT Gateway in 10.0.3.0/24      |

Each private subnet's route table routes `0.0.0.0/0` to the NAT Gateway in the **same AZ** to avoid inter-AZ data charges.

---

## 5. How Does NAT Gateway Know Where to Route Return Traffic?

The **NAT Gateway keeps track of connection state** using **port and IP translation**. It:
- Maps **each private IP and port** to its **Elastic IP and a unique port**
- Maintains **NAT translation tables** to return traffic to the originating private instance

This is done automatically by AWS.

---

## 6. Setting Up a NAT Gateway (CLI)

```bash
# Allocate Elastic IP
aws ec2 allocate-address

# Create NAT Gateway in public subnet
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
    --subnet-id subnet-public \
    --allocation-id eipalloc-xxxxxxx

# Update private subnet route table
aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id rtb-private \
    --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
    --nat-gateway-id nat-xxxxxxx
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use **NAT Gateway per AZ** for fault tolerance
- Use **NAT Gateway over NAT Instance** unless for specific dev/test needs
- Monitor usage with **VPC Flow Logs**
- Use **Elastic IPs** for NAT Gateways to maintain consistent outbound IPs

---

## 8. Cost Considerations

- NAT Gateway: Charged per **hour + GB of data processed**
- NAT Instance: Charged per **EC2 instance hour + bandwidth**, but needs management
