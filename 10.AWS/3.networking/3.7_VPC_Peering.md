# 3.7 VPC Peering – AWS Networking

## 1. What is VPC Peering?

**VPC Peering** enables **direct network routing** between two VPCs using **private IP addresses**, without requiring a gateway, VPN, or internet connection.

VPCs can be:
- In the same account
- In different AWS accounts
- In the same or different AWS regions

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Point-to-point connectivity** between VPCs
- Supports **inter-region and intra-region** peering
- **Low-latency, high-bandwidth** communication
- **Transitive routing is NOT supported**
- Supports **IPv4 and IPv6**

---

## 3. Use Cases

- Shared microservices across environments (e.g., Dev ↔ Prod)
- Centralized logging or monitoring
- Access to shared backend services (e.g., RDS, Redis)
- Multi-account network segmentation

---

## 4. How VPC Peering Works

```
VPC A (10.0.0.0/16)     <----- Peering Connection ----->    VPC B (10.1.0.0/16)
     |                                                                 |
  Subnets                                                          Subnets
     |                                                                 |
  Instances                                                       Instances
```

> Traffic flows **privately** and securely over the AWS backbone.

## 5. Setting Up a VPC Peering Connection (Steps)

1. Create a peering connection (either intra-account or cross-account)
2. Accept the peering connection
3. Update **route tables** in both VPCs
4. (Optional) Modify **security groups** and **NACLs** to allow traffic

### CLI Example:
```bash
aws ec2 create-vpc-peering-connection \
    --vpc-id vpc-aaaa1111 \
    --peer-vpc-id vpc-bbbb2222

aws ec2 accept-vpc-peering-connection \
    --vpc-peering-connection-id pcx-xxxxxx
```

---

## 6. Routing with Peering

Update **route tables** in both VPCs:

| Destination CIDR | Target         |
|------------------|----------------|
| 10.1.0.0/16      | pcx-xxxxxx     | ← From VPC A to VPC B           |
| 10.0.0.0/16      | pcx-xxxxxx     | ← From VPC B to VPC A           |

---

## 7. Transitive Routing Limitation

> VPC Peering does **not support transitive routing**.

If:
- VPC A is peered with VPC B
- VPC B is peered with VPC C  
→ **VPC A cannot talk to VPC C** through VPC B

---

## 8. Peering vs Transit Gateway

| Feature               | VPC Peering                     | Transit Gateway                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Scale                 | Point-to-point only              | Hub-and-spoke for 1000s of VPCs       |
| Transitive Routing    | ❌ Not supported                 | ✅ Supported                          |
| Inter-region Support  | ✅ Yes                           | ✅ Yes                                |
| Management Complexity | Medium (per connection)          | Low (centralized)                     |

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Avoid **overlapping CIDRs**
- Use **tagging** to track peering connections
- Use **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor traffic
- Be explicit in **route table updates** on both ends
- For many-to-many connectivity, prefer **Transit Gateway**

---

## 10. Limits

| Attribute                     | Default Limit          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Peering connections per VPC   | 125                    |
| Active/Accepted connections   | Varies by region       |
| Max route table entries       | 1000 (soft limit)      |
