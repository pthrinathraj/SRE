# 3.0 AWS Networking Overview â€“ CIDR, Subnetting, and IP Planning

## 1. Introduction to AWS Networking

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides scalable, secure, and isolated network environments using **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**. Networking forms the foundation for designing secure architectures, enabling communication between cloud resources and external systems.

Understanding **CIDR blocks**, **subnet masks**, and **IP allocation** is crucial when designing a VPC.

## 2. What is CIDR?

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets. CIDR notation specifies:
- A base IP (e.g., 10.0.0.0)
- A subnet mask length (e.g., /16)

**Example:**
```
CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
```

This block includes all IPs from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.255.255`.

## 3. Components of a CIDR Block

| Component     | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Network ID**| Identifies the VPC or subnet range     |
| **Host ID**   | Identifies individual IP addresses     |
| **Subnet Mask**| Determines how many bits are network vs host |

**Example:**
For `10.0.0.0/16`:
- 16 bits are for the network
- 16 bits are available for host addressing

---

## 4. How Many IPs in a CIDR Block?

Use the formula:
```
Total IPs = 2^(32 - subnet mask bits)
```

| CIDR Notation | Total IPs | Usable IPs | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| /16            | 65,536    | 65,531     | 5 reserved by AWS                          |
| /24            | 256       | 251         | Common subnet size                         |
| /28            | 16        | 11          | Minimum subnet size allowed in AWS         |

> AWS reserves **5 IPs per subnet**:
- Network address (.0)
- VPC router (.1)
- DNS server (.2)
- Future use (.3)
- Broadcast address (.255)

## 5. Subnet Masks and CIDR

The **subnet mask** defines how many IP addresses are available in a given subnet. Smaller subnet masks mean **more subnets**, but **fewer hosts** per subnet.

| Subnet Mask | CIDR | IPs Available | Typical Use Case              |
|-------------|------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 255.255.255.0 | /24 | 251 usable IPs | Public/private subnet          |
| 255.255.255.240 | /28 | 11 usable IPs | NAT Gateway, small services    |
| 255.255.0.0   | /16 | 65,531 usable  | Large VPC-wide deployments     |

---

## 6. Best Practices for IP Planning

- Always plan your **VPC CIDR** to avoid overlap with on-prem or other cloud networks (e.g., avoid 192.168.0.0/16 if used on-prem).
- Use **non-overlapping subnets** for public and private networks.
- Keep **/28 or smaller** for subnets hosting NAT Gateways or endpoints.
- For flexibility, start with **larger VPC blocks** (e.g., /16) and divide them into smaller subnets.
