# 13.1 Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## 1. What is Amazon ECS?

**Amazon ECS** is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. It supports Docker containers and integrates natively with AWS services like EC2, Fargate, IAM, CloudWatch, and ELB.

---

## 2. ECS Launch Types

| Launch Type | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **EC2**     | You manage the EC2 instances running your containers       |
| **Fargate** | AWS manages compute infrastructure (serverless containers) |

---

## 3. Key ECS Components

| Component          | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster**         | Logical grouping of container instances or Fargate resources    |
| **Task Definition** | Blueprint for containers (image, resources, env variables, etc.)|
| **Task**            | Running instantiation of a Task Definition                      |
| **Service**         | Ensures a specified number of tasks are running consistently    |
| **Container Agent** | Runs on EC2 to register instances and communicate with ECS      |

---

## 4. Task Definition Example (JSON)

```json
{
  "family": "my-task-def",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "my-container",
      "image": "nginx",
      "memory": 256,
      "cpu": 128,
      "essential": true,
      "portMappings": [{ "containerPort": 80, "hostPort": 80 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. ECS Service Types

| Service Type     | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Replica**       | Maintains a set number of task instances   |
| **Daemon**        | One task per EC2 instance in the cluster   |
| **Scheduled**     | Triggered by EventBridge or CloudWatch     |

---

## 6. ECS with Load Balancing

ECS integrates with:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

You can use **target groups** to route traffic to specific containers based on port and path rules.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs** for container logs
- **CloudWatch Metrics** for task and service monitoring
- **ECS Events** for task state changes
- Integration with **X-Ray** for tracing

---

## 8. ECS vs EKS vs Fargate

| Feature           | ECS                 | EKS                    | Fargate (with ECS/EKS)      |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Control Plane     | Fully managed       | Managed K8s control plane| N/A (runs tasks)           |
| Simplicity        | ✅ Simple           | ❌ Steep learning curve  | ✅ Simplest (no infrastructure) |
| Kubernetes        | ❌ Not supported    | ✅ Native support        | ✅ Runs K8s pods or ECS tasks |

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Use **Fargate** unless you need EC2 control
- Separate **staging and prod clusters**
- Use **parameter store or Secrets Manager** for config management
- Keep **task definitions versioned**
- Enable **autoscaling** for tasks and services
