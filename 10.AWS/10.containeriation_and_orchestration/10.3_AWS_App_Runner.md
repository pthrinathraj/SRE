# 13.4 AWS App Runner

## 1. What is AWS App Runner?

**AWS App Runner** is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy containerized web applications and APIs **directly from source code or a container image** without managing infrastructure.

It is designed for **developers who want to go from code to scalable web apps in minutes** with minimal AWS knowledge.

## 3. Supported Sources

- **GitHub Repository**
- **Amazon ECR Public or Private**
- **Dockerfile (from source code repo)**

---

## 4. Use Cases

- Deploying microservices or APIs
- Hosting backend web applications
- Running lightweight event-driven applications
- Rapid prototyping with fast CI/CD cycles

---

## 5. Workflow Overview

```
[ GitHub / ECR ] --> [ App Runner Service ] --> [ HTTPS Load Balanced Web App ]
```

App Runner builds and deploys the application, handles load balancing, scales it automatically, and manages security.

---

## 6. Sample CLI Deployment (ECR)

```bash
aws apprunner create-service \
  --service-name my-apprunner-service \
  --source-configuration ImageRepository={imageRepository={imageIdentifier=123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest, imageRepositoryType=ECR}} \
  --instance-configuration cpu=1024,memory=2048
```

## 7. Comparison: App Runner vs ECS vs Lambda

| Feature              | App Runner        | ECS/Fargate          | Lambda             |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Deployment Model     | Web apps/APIs     | Any containerized app | Event-driven        |
| Autoscaling          | ✅ Built-in       | ✅ With configuration | ✅                  |
| Cold Starts          | Moderate          | ❌ No (on EC2)         | ✅ Yes              |
| Traffic Handling     | HTTP requests     | Flexible (TCP/HTTP)   | Event-triggered     |
| Developer Simplicity | ✅ High           | Moderate              | ✅ High             |

---

## 8. Pricing

- Billed based on **vCPU & memory usage** per second
- Includes charges for active requests, build time (if source-based), and data transfer

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Use **ECR** for production-grade container deployment
- Connect to VPC if private resources are needed
- Enable **CloudWatch Logs** and **X-Ray tracing**
- Configure **health checks** and **deployment configurations**
- Use **App Runner Auto Scaling Configuration (ASC)** to customize scale settings

---

## 10. When to Use App Runner

- You're deploying a **web service or REST API**
- You want **minimal operational overhead**
- You don't need full control over infrastructure
- Ideal for **small teams or fast-moving projects**
