# 1.2.3 Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in AWS - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)?
**Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** is a unique type of load balancer in AWS that enables you to deploy, scale, and manage **third-party virtual appliances** (such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and traffic inspection tools) in a highly available and scalable manner.

It operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** and uses the **GENEVE tunneling protocol** to encapsulate traffic and forward it to appliance fleets.

## 2. Key Features
- **Transparent Traffic Inspection**: GWLB can insert itself in the path without requiring changes to application code or network setup.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales appliance fleets behind the scenes.
- **High Availability**: Spans multiple Availability Zones.
- **GENEVE Encapsulation**: Encapsulates traffic in GENEVE protocol for flexibility and metadata propagation.
- **Integration with VPC Endpoints**: Routes traffic through GWLB using Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints (GWLBE).

## 3. Use Cases
- Deploying **third-party firewalls** (e.g., Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check Point)
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Deep packet inspection
- Centralized NAT or proxy servers
- Traffic logging and analytics

## 4. How Gateway Load Balancer Works
1. GWLB sits between the client and destination, encapsulating traffic using GENEVE.
2. Sends encapsulated packets to **target groups** of appliances.
3. Appliances perform inspection or modification.
4. Packets are decapsulated and forwarded to the final destination.

## 5. Components of GWLB

| Component                  | Description                                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Listener**               | Always listens on port 6081 (GENEVE)                                   |
| **Target Group**           | Group of EC2 instances (appliances) to handle traffic                  |
| **GWLB Endpoint (GWLBE)**  | VPC endpoint that allows redirection of traffic through GWLB           |

## 6. GENEVE Protocol
- Standard tunneling protocol with metadata support
- GWLB uses **GENEVE port 6081**
- Allows the GWLB to carry context (such as source IP, protocol) to appliance targets

## 7. GWLB vs ALB vs NLB

| Feature               | GWLB                        | ALB                         | NLB                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| OSI Layer             | 3 (Network)                 | 7 (Application)             | 4 (Transport)               |
| Protocol              | GENEVE                      | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket      | TCP, UDP, TLS               |
| Target Type           | EC2 (virtual appliances)    | EC2, IP, Lambda             | EC2, IP, Lambda             |
| Primary Use Case      | Appliance chaining          | Web routing                 | High-speed TCP/UDP traffic  |
| TLS Termination       | No                          | Yes                         | Optional                    |

## 8. Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch metrics**: Traffic stats, healthy targets, processed bytes
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Useful for deep network-level insights
- **Appliance-level logging**: Third-party tools log inspection details

## 9. Pricing
You are billed based on:
- **GWLB running hours**
- **Data processed (GB)**

## 10. Best Practices
- Use **multiple AZs** for HA appliance deployments
- Integrate with **VPC Ingress Routing** for centralized traffic filtering
- Monitor **health checks** for appliance health and availability
- Secure access using **IAM policies** on GWLBE
- Tag and version-control appliances for lifecycle management
