# 1.2.1 Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is an Application Load Balancer?
The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is part of the AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service. It operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model and is optimized for handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

It enables intelligent routing decisions based on request content, such as:
- Hostnames
- Paths
- Query strings
- HTTP headers
- Source IPs

## 2. Key Features
- **Content-based routing**: Host-based and path-based routing
- **Container support**: Supports ECS and EKS (multiple ports per instance)
- **WebSocket and HTTP/2 support**
- **Integrated security**: SSL termination, AWS WAF, authentication (OIDC, Cognito)
- **Advanced monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics, access logs, and AWS X-Ray tracing

## 3. Components of ALB

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Listeners**     | Define how ALB handles traffic (e.g., HTTP:80 or HTTPS:443)                 |
| **Target Groups** | Group of registered resources (EC2, Lambda, IPs) ALB routes traffic to      |
| **Rules**         | Conditions and actions (e.g., route `/admin` to specific target group)      |
| **Targets**       | The compute resources (EC2, Lambda, etc.) in the target group               |

## 4. Supported Target Types
- EC2 Instances
- IP Addresses
- Lambda Functions
- ECS Tasks (bridge, host, awsvpc)

## 5. ALB vs NLB vs CLB

| Feature             | ALB (Layer 7)           | NLB (Layer 4)           | CLB (Deprecated)          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Protocol Support     | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket  | TCP, UDP, TLS            | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP           |
| Routing              | Host/Path/Query         | IP:Port based            | Basic Layer 4 & 7          |
| Performance          | Good for Web Apps       | High throughput/low latency | Legacy compatibility     |
| SSL Termination      | Yes                     | Optional                 | Yes                        |

## 6. Use Cases
- Web applications with complex routing logic
- Hosting multiple domains or subdomains
- Containerized services with dynamic ports
- Authentication gateways with OIDC or Cognito

## 7. How It Works
1. A user sends a request to the ALB DNS endpoint.
2. The ALB listener processes the request and evaluates its rules.
3. Based on rules, it forwards the request to a target group.
4. A healthy target (EC2/Lambda/etc.) handles the request and returns the response.

## 8. Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics for request count, latency, error rates
- **Access Logs**: Detailed logs stored in S3
- **AWS X-Ray**: Trace request paths through ALB to backend services

## 9. Pricing
You are billed for:
- **Running hours** of the ALB
- **LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units)**:
  - New/active connections
  - Processed bytes
  - Rule evaluations

## 10. Best Practices
- Use HTTPS with SSL termination on the ALB
- Offload auth using ALB’s Cognito/OIDC integration
- Enable access logs and CloudWatch alarms
- Implement WAF for added security
- Use Auto Scaling + ALB for high availability
