# 1.2.2 Network Load Balancer (NLB) in AWS - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is a Network Load Balancer?
The **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is part of AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and operates at **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**. It is designed for handling millions of **TCP, UDP, and TLS connections per second** with ultra-low latency.

## 2. Key Features
- Layer 4 routing (TCP, UDP, TLS)
- Static IP addresses per AZ or Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)
- Zonal isolation and failover
- TLS termination (optional)
- Preserves client source IP
- High throughput with sub-millisecond latency

## 3. Components of NLB

| Component         | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Listeners**     | Define protocol and port (e.g., TCP:443)                    |
| **Target Groups** | Group of registered EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambdas |
| **Targets**       | Compute resources or Lambda functions                        |

## 4. Supported Target Types
- EC2 Instances
- IP Addresses (AWS or on-prem)
- Lambda Functions
- PrivateLink Endpoints

## 5. Use Cases
- High-performance, low-latency applications
- Financial or trading platforms
- Real-time gaming servers
- TLS-heavy applications needing offloading
- Hybrid cloud environments

## 6. NLB vs ALB vs CLB

| Feature             | NLB                        | ALB                        | CLB (Deprecated)          |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Layer               | 4 (Transport)              | 7 (Application)             | 4 & 7                      |
| Protocols           | TCP, UDP, TLS              | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket      | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP           |
| Static IP           | Yes                        | No                          | No                         |
| TLS Termination     | Yes (optional)             | Yes                         | Yes                        |
| Target Types        | EC2, IP, Lambda            | EC2, IP, Lambda             | EC2                        |
| Use Cases           | High performance, non-HTTP | Microservices, web routing  | Legacy                     |

## 7. How It Works
1. Clients connect via the NLBâ€™s **DNS or static IP**.
2. NLB listener forwards requests to a **target group** based on protocol and port.
3. Healthy **targets** handle requests using **preserved client IP**.
4. NLB performs **zonal failover** for resilience.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch**: Active connections, new flows, processed bytes
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Capture detailed network traffic
- **Access Logs**: Not natively supported (use flow logs instead)
- **X-Ray**: Not supported for Layer 4

## 9. Pricing
You pay for:
- **NLB running hours**
- **LCUs (Load Balancer Capacity Units)**, calculated based on:
  - New connections per second
  - Active connections
  - Data processed

## 10. Best Practices
- Use **multi-AZ deployments** for high availability
- Leverage **TLS offloading** for central cert management
- Configure **health checks** on required ports and protocols
- Use **Elastic IPs** or BYOIP for static addresses
- Integrate with **Global Accelerator** for better global performance
