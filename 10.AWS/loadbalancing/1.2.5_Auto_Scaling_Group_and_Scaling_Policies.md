# 1.2.5 Auto Scaling Group and Scaling Policies - Detailed Guide

## 1. What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)?
An **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** in AWS is a service that enables automatic scaling of Amazon EC2 instances based on demand. It helps maintain application availability and allows dynamic adjustments of compute capacity to meet traffic requirements cost-effectively.

## 2. Key Components of ASG

| Component           | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Launch Template** | Defines how new instances are configured (AMI, instance type, key pair) |
| **Minimum Size**    | The lowest number of instances in the group                              |
| **Maximum Size**    | The upper limit for instance count                                       |
| **Desired Capacity**| Number of instances ASG attempts to maintain                             |
| **Scaling Policies**| Rules that adjust desired capacity based on CloudWatch alarms or metrics|

## 3. Benefits of Using ASGs
- High availability through fault-tolerant, self-healing infrastructure
- Dynamic scaling based on load
- Cost optimization by removing idle resources
- Integration with ELB, CloudWatch, and SNS

## 4. Scaling Types

### a. Dynamic Scaling
Automatically increases or decreases capacity based on metric thresholds.

- **Target Tracking Scaling**: Maintain a metric at a target value (e.g., keep CPU at 60%)
- **Step Scaling**: Scale by defined steps based on CloudWatch alarms
- **Simple Scaling**: Legacy method—triggered by one alarm with cooldown periods

### b. Scheduled Scaling
Scale the group at specific times (e.g., scale out during business hours).

### c. Predictive Scaling (Advanced)
Uses machine learning to forecast traffic and scale proactively. Works best for consistent, predictable workloads.

## 5. Common Scaling Metrics
- CPU utilization
- Memory (custom metric via CloudWatch Agent)
- Request count per target (ALB/NLB)
- Network traffic (in/out)
- Queue length (e.g., SQS depth)

## 6. Cooldown Period
A **cooldown period** prevents new scaling actions from launching during a stabilization window.

- Default cooldown: 300 seconds
- You can define cooldown per policy

## 7. Lifecycle Hooks
Hooks allow you to pause instance transitions (Pending → InService or Terminating → Terminated) for:
- Configuration scripts
- Logging
- Health checks

Example:
```bash
aws autoscaling put-lifecycle-hook \
  --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --lifecycle-transition autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING \
  --hook-name configure-server
```

## 8. Termination Policies
Control which instance gets terminated during scale-in.

Options include:
- Closest to next instance hour
- Oldest launch configuration
- Oldest instance
- Default: Random

## 9. Integration with Load Balancers
ASGs work seamlessly with:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- Health checks determine which instances are considered healthy and in service.

## 10. Best Practices
- Use **target tracking** as the simplest and most efficient scaling policy
- **Distribute across multiple AZs** for fault tolerance
- **Tag ASG instances** for visibility and access control
- Implement **graceful shutdown scripts** during termination
- Use **lifecycle hooks** to bootstrap instances safely
