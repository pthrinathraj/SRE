# 2.5 Packet Capture and Analysis – In-Depth Guide

Packet capture allows network professionals to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot network traffic at a granular level. In this section, we’ll explore how to capture packets using tools like `tcpdump` and `Wireshark`, and how to interpret them effectively.

---

## 📦 1. What is Packet Capture?

Packet capturing involves intercepting data packets moving across a network. Captured data can be used to:
- Diagnose network issues
- Inspect protocol behavior (e.g., TCP handshake)
- Detect malicious traffic
- Measure latency and packet loss

---

## 🧪 2. Using `tcpdump` for Packet Capture (CLI)

### 🔹 Basic Capture on Interface:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```

### 🔹 Filter by Port:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```

### 🔹 Capture Packets to File:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```

### 🔹 Read Capture File:
```bash
tcpdump -r capture.pcap
```

### 📤 Sample Output:
```
12:01:55.123456 IP 192.168.1.100.54321 > 93.184.216.34.80: Flags [S], seq 12345678, win 64240, length 0
```

### 🧠 Interpretation:
- `Flags [S]`: SYN flag, part of TCP handshake
- Source IP: `192.168.1.100`, source port: `54321`
- Destination IP: `93.184.216.34`, port: `80`
- This is the initial connection attempt

## 🔍 3. Using Wireshark for Deep Packet Analysis

Wireshark is a powerful GUI tool for protocol-level inspection.

### 🔹 Steps:
1. Launch Wireshark and select the correct network interface
2. Start capture
3. Apply filters (e.g., `http`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100`, `tcp.port == 443`)
4. Inspect packet layers: Ethernet > IP > TCP/UDP > Application

### 🔹 Filters:
- `tcp` – only show TCP packets
- `ip.addr == 192.168.1.10` – filter packets by host
- `http.request` – show HTTP requests

### 🔹 Useful Views:
- Packet List: overview of traffic
- Packet Details: full breakdown of headers and payload
- Packet Bytes: raw hex + ASCII view

## 🎯 4. Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Tool | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Verify HTTP traffic | tcpdump, Wireshark | `tcpdump -i eth0 port 80` |
| Capture login attempts | Wireshark | Filter `ftp`, `ssh` |
| Diagnose DNS issues | tcpdump, Wireshark | Filter `udp port 53` |
| Analyze TLS handshake | Wireshark | `tcp.port == 443` filter |

---

## 🛡️ 5. Security Considerations

- Capturing packets on a network can expose sensitive data
- Only capture with proper authorization
- Use encryption (TLS) to mitigate inspection risks

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Task | Command / Tool | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Capture on interface | `tcpdump -i eth0` | Default view |
| Filter by port | `tcpdump port 80` | Capture HTTP only |
| Save to file | `tcpdump -w file.pcap` | View later in Wireshark |
| Open in GUI | Wireshark | Best for deep inspection |
| Filter by host | `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100` | In Wireshark filter bar |
