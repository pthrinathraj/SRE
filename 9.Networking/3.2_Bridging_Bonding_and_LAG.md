# 3.2 Bridging, Bonding, and LAG (Link Aggregation)

---

## 🌉 What is Bridging?
Bridging connects two or more network interfaces to behave like a single network segment. It operates at **Layer 2** and forwards Ethernet frames based on MAC addresses.

### Use Case:
- Virtualization: Bridge physical NIC to a virtual switch for VMs

### Linux Example:
```bash
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
sudo ip link set dev eth1 master br0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up
```

### 🔍 Verify:
```bash
bridge link
ip addr show br0
```

## 🔗 What is Bonding?
Bonding combines multiple NICs into a single logical interface to improve:
- **Redundancy** (failover)
- **Throughput** (load balancing)

### Modes:
- `mode=0` (round-robin)
- `mode=1` (active-backup)
- `mode=4` (802.3ad, LACP)

### Linux Example (with active-backup):
```bash
sudo modprobe bonding
sudo ip link add bond0 type bond
sudo ip link set bond0 type bond mode active-backup
sudo ip link set eth0 master bond0
sudo ip link set eth1 master bond0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev bond0
sudo ip link set bond0 up
```

## 🔄 What is Link Aggregation (LAG)?
LAG (or EtherChannel) combines multiple physical links into a single logical link for:
- Bandwidth increase
- Redundancy

### LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol):
- Dynamic protocol used in `mode=4` bonding
- Requires switch configuration support

### Network Use Cases:
- Data center uplinks
- High-throughput or high-availability server interfaces
- Network trunking
