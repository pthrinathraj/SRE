# 3.9 Kubernetes Networking Deep Dive

Kubernetes networking allows containers to communicate across nodes and services, both internally and externally, using well-defined standards and powerful abstractions. Understanding its architecture is essential for designing scalable and secure applications.

## üß± Core Concepts of Kubernetes Networking

1. **Pod-to-Pod Communication**:
   - Every Pod gets a unique IP address
   - No NAT between Pods (flat networking)
   - Pods on different nodes can talk via the CNI plugin

2. **Service Abstraction**:
   - Stable DNS name and virtual IP (ClusterIP)
   - Selects backend Pods using labels
   - Handles load balancing and failover across Pod replicas

3. **Cluster Networking**:
   - Requires CNI plugin (Calico, Flannel, Cilium, Weave)
   - Enables inter-Pod communication across nodes

4. **NodePort and LoadBalancer Services**:
   - **NodePort**: Exposes service on port across all nodes
   - **LoadBalancer**: Requests external load balancer from cloud provider

5. **Ingress Controller**:
   - Manages external HTTP(S) access to services
   - Supports SSL, path/host-based routing, rewrites

## üîå Container Network Interface (CNI)

CNI plugins implement the actual networking between nodes and Pods.

Popular CNI options:
- **Calico** ‚Äì NetworkPolicy support and BGP
- **Flannel** ‚Äì Simpler, less secure, VXLAN-based
- **Cilium** ‚Äì eBPF-powered, supports deep observability
- **Weave** ‚Äì Fast deployment, encrypted mesh

## üß™ Example: ClusterIP vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer

| Type          | Internal? | External Access | Use Case                        |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| ClusterIP     | Yes       | No               | Default, internal-only service   |
| NodePort      | Yes       | Yes (via node IP)| Direct port on each node        |
| LoadBalancer  | Yes       | Yes (LB IP)      | Cloud-managed external access    |

## üîê Network Policies

Kubernetes NetworkPolicies control Pod-to-Pod traffic:
- Define ingress/egress rules based on labels, namespaces, IP blocks
- Require CNI plugin support (Calico, Cilium)

**Example: Deny all except frontend access to backend**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

## üåê Workflow: How a User Accesses `example.com` Hosted on Kubernetes

1. **DNS Resolution**
   - A user on the internet types `example.com` into a browser.
   - A DNS provider (e.g., Route 53) resolves `example.com` to the public IP of a cloud Load Balancer.

2. **Cloud Load Balancer**
   - Routes the HTTP/HTTPS request to the **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) running in the Kubernetes cluster.
   - The Load Balancer uses Service Type `LoadBalancer` to route external traffic to a NodePort exposed by the Ingress controller.

3. **Ingress Controller**
   - Listens for incoming requests.
   - Matches the `Host` header `example.com` with the Ingress object definition.
   - Routes traffic to the appropriate Kubernetes Service (based on path or host rules).

4. **Kubernetes Service (ClusterIP)**
   - The service is configured with selectors that match the target Pods.
   - Load balances traffic across healthy Pods in the backend Deployment.

5. **Deployment and Pods**
   - The Deployment ensures a defined number of Pods are running.
   - Each Pod runs the application container serving `example.com` traffic.

6. **NetworkPolicy (Optional)**
   - If configured, NetworkPolicies are enforced to allow only Ingress-controller-to-app communication.
   - Blocks unauthorized access from other Pods or namespaces.

This routing stack includes:
- External DNS
- LoadBalancer Service
- Ingress Controller
- Ingress Object
- ClusterIP Service
- Deployment/Pods
- (Optional) NetworkPolicies for traffic control
