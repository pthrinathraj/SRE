# 3.7.a NGINX Deep Dive – Reverse Proxy, Load Balancer, and API Gateway

NGINX is one of the most widely used open-source reverse proxies and web servers. It can be configured as a static web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, or even a basic API gateway.

---

## 📦 What is NGINX?

NGINX ("engine-x") is a high-performance web server that supports:

- Static and dynamic content delivery
- Reverse proxying with caching
- Load balancing with health checks
- SSL/TLS termination
- Basic API gateway features

NGINX is event-driven, non-blocking, and uses asynchronous request handling – making it highly scalable.

## 🔧 Installation

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
```

**CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install nginx
```

Start and enable service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

## 🔁 Reverse Proxy with NGINX

Forward traffic to an upstream server (e.g., Node.js, Flask, Tomcat).

**Basic config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

## ⚖️ Load Balancing with NGINX

**Round-robin example:**
```nginx
http {
    upstream app_cluster {
        server 10.0.0.101;
        server 10.0.0.102;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app_cluster;
        }
    }
}
```

**Least connections:**
```nginx
upstream app_cluster {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.0.101;
    server 10.0.0.102;
}
```

---

## 🔒 SSL Termination with NGINX

**Terminate HTTPS:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    }
}
```

**Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

---

## 🚀 API Gateway Features (Basic)

- Add custom headers
- Rate limiting via `limit_req_zone`
- Authentication with JWT via Lua or third-party modules
- OpenResty or NGINX Plus extends capabilities

**Rate limiting example:**
```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=5r/s;

server {
    location /api/ {
        limit_req zone=one burst=10;
        proxy_pass http://api_backend;
    }
}
```

---

## 📄 Logging & Monitoring

- Access logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- Error logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
- Can integrate with Prometheus, Grafana via exporters

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

```bash
nginx -t          # test configuration
sudo nginx -s reload  # reload config without downtime
curl -I http://localhost  # check response headers
```

NGINX is versatile, fast, and critical for routing and securing modern web apps. You can combine reverse proxy, load balancing, and API gateway functions in a single, lightweight service.
