# 3.7 Reverse Proxy and API Gateway

Reverse proxies and API gateways are crucial components for routing, securing, and scaling application traffic in modern infrastructures.

---

## üîÅ What is a Reverse Proxy?

A **reverse proxy** sits in front of backend services and forwards client requests to them. It can also cache responses, compress traffic, enforce SSL, or authenticate clients.

**Common reverse proxies:**
- NGINX
- HAProxy
- Envoy
- Apache HTTPD (mod_proxy)

**Benefits:**
- SSL termination
- Load balancing
- Response caching
- URL rewrites
- Hides backend topology from clients

**Example ‚Äì NGINX Reverse Proxy**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## üì° What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** manages API traffic. It often sits in front of microservices and provides enhanced controls such as:
- Request routing and transformation
- Authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
- Rate limiting / throttling
- Logging and monitoring
- Caching and analytics

**Popular Tools:**
- AWS API Gateway
- Kong
- Apigee (Google)
- NGINX Plus
- Envoy with Istio

## üîç Reverse Proxy vs API Gateway

| Feature               | Reverse Proxy           | API Gateway                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Primary Use           | Routing, SSL, caching    | API lifecycle and traffic control  |
| Protocol Focus        | HTTP/S, TCP              | HTTP APIs, gRPC                    |
| Auth, Throttle, etc.  | Basic via plugins        | Built-in                           |
| Developer Management  | No                       | Yes                                |
| Example Tool          | NGINX                    | AWS API Gateway                    |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS API Gateway Example

- Create a REST API with resources and methods (e.g., `GET /users`)
- Integrate with Lambda or HTTP backend
- Add usage plans, API keys, or Cognito auth
- Deploy stages with throttling limits

Reverse proxies and API gateways help manage application scale, security, and observability ‚Äî especially in distributed systems and microservice architectures.
