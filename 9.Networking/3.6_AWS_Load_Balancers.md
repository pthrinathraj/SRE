# 3.6 AWS Load Balancers – In-Depth Guide

AWS provides several types of load balancers, each designed for specific use cases. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across targets like EC2, Lambda, containers, or IPs for high availability and fault tolerance.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Load Balancers?

- Distribute workload evenly across servers
- Improve fault tolerance and high availability
- Enable blue-green and canary deployments
- Scale applications horizontally

---

## 📊 Types of AWS Load Balancers

| Layer | Type           | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| L4    | NLB (Network Load Balancer) | Handles TCP/UDP at transport layer |
| L7    | ALB (Application Load Balancer) | Operates at HTTP/HTTPS level with routing rules |
| L4/L7 | CLB (Classic Load Balancer) | Legacy load balancer with basic capabilities |
| L3    | GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer) | For third-party firewalls and appliances |

---

## 🔷 Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Path-based and host-based routing
- Supports AWS WAF, Cognito authentication
- Ideal for ECS, EKS, microservices

**Use Case:**  
Route `/api/*` to one service, `/web/*` to another.

---

## 🔷 Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
- High-performance and low-latency
- Supports static and Elastic IPs
- Ideal for real-time or non-HTTP apps

---

## 🔷 Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

- Legacy support for L4 and L7
- No path-based routing
- **Deprecated for new workloads**; use ALB or NLB instead
- Still active in legacy systems

---

## 🔷 Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

- Layer 3 appliance load balancing
- Supports inline firewalls and packet inspection
- Ideal for service chaining with third-party appliances

---

## 🛠️ Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Round Robin** – Rotate traffic across targets
- **Least Connections** – Send to target with least connections
- **IP Hash** – Sticky sessions for same client IP

---

## 🧪 Example – AWS ALB Routing

1. User request hits ALB DNS (e.g., `my-alb-123.elb.amazonaws.com`)
2. Listener on port 80 or 443 processes request
3. ALB evaluates routing rules (e.g., URL path)
4. Routes traffic to correct Target Group
5. Health checks ensure only healthy targets are used

## ⚙️ Nginx Reverse Proxy Example (for comparison)

```nginx
http {
  upstream backend {
    server app1.example.com;
    server app2.example.com;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```

AWS Load Balancers are essential for building highly available, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications.
