# 3.8 DNS in Cloud and Kubernetes

Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for resolving human-readable domain names to IP addresses. In cloud and Kubernetes environments, DNS evolves to include internal service discovery, traffic management, and regional failover capabilities.

---

## 🌐 What is DNS?

DNS is a hierarchical, distributed database that maps domain names (e.g., `example.com`) to IP addresses (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).

Key components:
- **A/AAAA Records**: Point to IPv4/IPv6 addresses
- **CNAME**: Alias of another domain name
- **MX**: Mail servers
- **NS**: Name servers
- **PTR**: Reverse DNS

## ☁️ DNS in Cloud Providers

### 🔷 AWS Route 53

- Scalable, highly available DNS service
- Supports:
  - Public and Private Hosted Zones
  - Latency-based routing
  - Health checks and failover
  - Weighted routing
  - Geo-location routing
- Integrated with ELB, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront

**Example:** Route traffic to the closest healthy region

#### 🔄 How Route 53 Differs from Load Balancer Routing

| Characteristic             | Route 53 (DNS-based)                          | Load Balancer (Network-based)        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Resolution Point          | Client-side DNS resolution                    | Request processed at LB in cloud     |
| Routing Criteria          | Geolocation, weight, latency, failover, etc.  | Listener rules, target group health |
| Visibility                | Works before traffic reaches infrastructure   | Controls flow within infrastructure |
| Session Persistence       | No built-in stickiness (client DNS cache)     | Supports sticky sessions             |

> **Key Difference:** Route 53 determines _where_ the client connects, while a Load Balancer determines _how_ the request is distributed internally.

### 🔶 Azure DNS

- Authoritative DNS hosting service
- Integrated with Azure Traffic Manager
- Supports geo-routing, failover, and split-horizon DNS

---

### 🟢 GCP Cloud DNS

- Scalable and high-performing DNS
- Integrated with Cloud Load Balancing
- Supports DNSSEC, forwarding zones, peering

---

## 🧩 DNS in Kubernetes

Kubernetes includes built-in DNS for service discovery:
- Each Service object gets a DNS name
- Uses **CoreDNS** (default) or **kube-dns** (legacy)
- Name format: `service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`

**Example:**  
Pod accesses `db-service.default.svc.cluster.local`

---

## 🔁 ExternalName Services

Map internal service to external DNS name.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-db
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: db.external.com
```

---

## 🔐 DNS Security

- **DNSSEC**: Prevent spoofing by signing DNS data
- **Split-Horizon DNS**: Different views inside vs outside VPC
- **Firewalls/Resolvers**: Cloud-native DNS protections

---

DNS is foundational to service discovery, traffic routing, and application resilience in modern infrastructure.
