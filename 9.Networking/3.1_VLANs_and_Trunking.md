# 3.1 Virtual LANs (VLANs) and Trunking – In-Depth Guide

This section explains Virtual LANs (VLANs), trunking, tagging, and configuration examples, starting from foundational LAN concepts.

## 🌐 What is a LAN?

A **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a group of computers and devices interconnected within a limited physical area, such as a building or office. LANs are:

- Fast and low-latency
- Private and isolated from the public internet
- Scalable by expanding switch capacity

As the network grows, broadcast traffic increases, potentially reducing performance.

---

## 🧠 What is a VLAN?

A **Virtual LAN (VLAN)** logically segments a physical network into isolated broadcast domains.

- Operates at **Layer 2** (Data Link Layer)
- Identified using **VLAN IDs (1–4094)**
- VLANs require Layer 3 routing to communicate across boundaries

---

## 🚀 Why VLANs are Needed

- Segment traffic by departments (e.g., HR, Engineering)
- Enhance network performance by reducing broadcast domains
- Enforce policy and security per department/application
- Enable multi-tenant or multi-purpose networking
- Simplify topology without physical rewiring

---

## 🧱 VLAN Tagging (IEEE 802.1Q)

VLAN tags are added to Ethernet frames to mark traffic belonging to specific VLANs.

```
[Ethernet Header | 802.1Q Tag | Payload | FCS]
```

- The 802.1Q tag contains the **VLAN ID**
- Frames without tags are considered untagged

## 🔌 Access vs Trunk Ports

| Type        | Description                                         | Use Case                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Access Port | Sends/receives untagged traffic (one VLAN)          | PC, printer, IP phone             |
| Trunk Port  | Carries tagged traffic for multiple VLANs           | Switch uplinks, hypervisors       |

---

## 🧪 VLAN Configuration on Linux

```bash
# Create VLAN 100 on eth0
sudo ip link add link eth0 name eth0.100 type vlan id 100

# Assign IP address
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.1/24 dev eth0.100

# Enable the interface
sudo ip link set dev eth0.100 up
```

### 🔍 Verify:
```bash
ip -d link show eth0.100
```

## 🏢 VLAN Use Cases in Data Centers

- Isolate production/staging/test environments
- Separate tenants in private cloud deployments
- Segment web/app/database layers for security and performance

---

## 🔒 Bonus: Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)

To allow devices in different VLANs to talk, use Layer 3 routing. Example on a router:

```bash
interface eth0.10
  encapsulation dot1Q 10
  ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

interface eth0.20
  encapsulation dot1Q 20
  ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
```

This technique is known as **router-on-a-stick** and enables routing between VLANs over a single trunk link.

This concludes **3.1 – VLANs and Trunking**. Next: **3.2 – Bridging, Bonding, and LAG**.
