# 2.3 DNS Resolution in Practice – In-Depth Guide

This section explores how DNS resolution works from the command line, using tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, and by inspecting `/etc/resolv.conf`. You'll learn to diagnose common DNS issues, analyze resolution paths, and understand how recursive and iterative lookups work under the hood.

---

## 🌍 1. Understanding DNS Resolution

DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names like `example.com` into IP addresses that computers use to communicate.

### 🔁 DNS Lookup Flow:
1. **Local Cache:** Check the OS-level DNS cache.
2. **/etc/hosts:** Manual hostname-to-IP entries.
3. **Resolver configuration:** DNS servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. **Recursive Resolution:** The DNS resolver queries:
   - Root servers → Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (like `.com`) → Authoritative name server for the domain

This resolution can be **recursive** (the DNS resolver handles everything for you) or **iterative** (the resolver returns referral responses).

---

## 📂 2. Check Current DNS Configuration

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

### 📤 Sample Output:
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```

### 🧠 Interpretation:
- These nameservers are used for all DNS queries unless overridden.
- If you're using `systemd-resolved`, this file may be a symlink.

## 🧪 3. `dig` – DNS Query Tool

The `dig` (Domain Information Groper) command provides detailed DNS query and response information.

### 🔹 Basic A Record Query:
```bash
dig example.com
```

### 📤 Output:
```
; <<>> DiG 9.18.12 <<>> example.com
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 12345
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;example.com.           IN  A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.    3600    IN  A   93.184.216.34

;; Query time: 17 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Fri Mar 28 14:00:00 UTC 2025
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 56
```

### 🧠 Interpretation:
- `ANSWER SECTION`: IP address for the domain
- `Query time`: Time taken to resolve
- `SERVER`: Which DNS server responded

### 🔹 Use a Specific Nameserver:
```bash
dig @1.1.1.1 example.com
```

### 🔹 Query Different Record Types:
```bash
dig example.com MX       # Mail servers
dig example.com NS       # Name servers
```

### 🔹 Trace Resolution Path:
```bash
dig +trace example.com
```

---

## 🧪 4. `nslookup` – Legacy DNS Tool

```bash
nslookup example.com
```

### 📤 Output:
```
Server:  8.8.8.8
Address: 8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

### 🧠 Interpretation:
- Shows IP for domain using system DNS settings.
- `Non-authoritative` means the answer came from a cache.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Inspecting and Modifying DNS Runtime Behavior

### 🔹 `systemd-resolve --status`
Shows current DNS settings, per-interface DNS, and cache state.

### 🔹 Flush DNS Cache:
```bash
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```

### 🔹 Restart DNS services:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

---

## 🧭 6. Troubleshooting DNS Issues

### 🔹 Symptoms:
- Websites not loading but IP pings work
- Delays in web resolution
- Hostname not resolving

### 🔸 Commands:
```bash
ping example.com
host example.com
systemd-resolve --status
```

### 🔸 Strategies:
- Try alternate DNS servers (e.g., Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`, Google `8.8.8.8`)
- Check firewall for blocked port 53 (UDP/TCP)
- Use `dig +trace` to see where resolution fails

## ✅ Summary Table

| Task | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| View DNS servers | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | Shows current resolvers |
| Basic query | `dig example.com` | A record lookup |
| Use custom DNS | `dig @1.1.1.1 example.com` | Override system DNS |
| Other record types | `dig example.com MX` | Query MX, NS, CNAME etc. |
| Trace path | `dig +trace example.com` | Shows root-to-authoritative steps |
| Flush cache | `systemd-resolve --flush-caches` | Clear local DNS cache |
| View DNS status | `systemd-resolve --status` | DNS per interface |
