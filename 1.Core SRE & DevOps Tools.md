# 🧱 Section A: Linux

## ✅ 1. Introduction

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is the backbone of modern infrastructure, widely used in servers, containers, networking devices, and embedded systems. Linux is favored in the SRE world for its stability, flexibility, strong CLI tools, and robust security model.

---

## ✅ 2. Key Components

- **Kernel** – Core that manages hardware, processes, memory, and system calls.
- **Shell** – Interface between user and kernel (e.g., bash, zsh).
- **File System Hierarchy** – `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/usr`, etc.
- **Package Manager** – `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `zypper`, etc.
- **Init System** – `systemd`, `init`, `upstart`.
- **Networking Tools** – `ip`, `ss`, `netstat`, `iptables`, etc.
- **Processes & Scheduling** – `ps`, `top`, `nice`, `cron`, `at`.

## ✅ 3. Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` | File navigation |
| `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir` | File management |
| `chmod`, `chown` | Permissions and ownership |

## ✅ 4. Pros & Cons

### ✅ Pros:
- Open-source and free
- Lightweight and customizable
- Large community and documentation
- Secure with robust user and permission management
- Ideal for scripting and automation (bash, cron, etc.)

### ❌ Cons:
