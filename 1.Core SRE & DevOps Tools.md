# 🧱 Section A: Linux

## ✅ 1. Introduction

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is the backbone of modern infrastructure, widely used in servers, containers, networking devices, and embedded systems. Linux is favored in the SRE world for its stability, flexibility, strong CLI tools, and robust security model.

---

## ✅ 2. Key Components

- **Kernel** – Core that manages hardware, processes, memory, and system calls.
- **Shell** – Interface between user and kernel (e.g., bash, zsh).
- **File System Hierarchy** – `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/usr`, etc.
- **Package Manager** – `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `zypper`, etc.
- **Init System** – `systemd`, `init`, `upstart`.
- **Networking Tools** – `ip`, `ss`, `netstat`, `iptables`, etc.
- **Processes & Scheduling** – `ps`, `top`, `nice`, `cron`, `at`.

---

## ✅ 3. Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` | File navigation |
| `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir` | File management |
| `chmod`, `chown` | Permissions and ownership |
| `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `nice` | Process management |
| `df`, `du` | Disk usage |
| `ifconfig`, `ip`, `ping`, `traceroute` | Network configuration |
| `journalctl`, `dmesg`, `logrotate` | Log and system diagnostics |
| `systemctl`, `service` | Service management |

---

## ✅ 4. Pros & Cons

### ✅ Pros:
- Open-source and free
- Lightweight and customizable
- Large community and documentation
- Secure with robust user and permission management
- Ideal for scripting and automation (bash, cron, etc.)

### ❌ Cons:
- Steeper learning curve for beginners
- Some commercial software lacks Linux support
- Varies slightly across distributions

# 🧱 Section C: Linux – Best Practices & Considerations

This section outlines key best practices and operational considerations for working with Linux systems in a production or enterprise environment, especially relevant to SRE and DevOps roles.

---

## ✅ 1. Security Best Practices

- **Use SSH Keys instead of passwords** for secure authentication.
- **Disable root login** over SSH (`PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
- **Keep the system updated** regularly with security patches.
- **Use `sudo` instead of `su`** for access control and auditability.
- **Configure firewalls (iptables, nftables, ufw)** to allow only required ports.
- **Enable SELinux or AppArmor** for mandatory access control when possible.
- **Audit logs regularly** (`/var/log/`, `auditd`).

---

## ✅ 2. File System & Storage Management

- **Partition disks wisely** (separate `/var`, `/home`, `/tmp`, `/`).
- **Use LVM** for flexible volume management.
- **Monitor disk usage** and inode usage to avoid outages.
- **Automate log rotation** using `logrotate`.
- **Set `noexec` and `nodev` flags** on `/tmp` and other sensitive mounts.
- **Test and document your `fstab` changes** before reboot.

---

## ✅ 3. Performance Optimization

- **Use `htop`, `iotop`, `vmstat`, `mpstat`** for resource monitoring.
- **Tune kernel parameters** with `sysctl` based on workload.
- **Profile long-running processes** using `strace`, `perf`, `dstat`.
- **Use swap space wisely** – too much can degrade performance.
- **Monitor load average** and distinguish between CPU-bound vs I/O-bound bottlenecks.

---

## ✅ 4. Process & Service Management

- **Prefer `systemd` services over init scripts** for consistency.
- **Enable only essential services** at boot.
- **Write custom services with proper unit files**.
- **Monitor failed services** with `systemctl --failed`.

---

## ✅ 5. Cron Jobs & Automation

- **Log cron job output** explicitly to catch failures.
- **Always define absolute paths** in cron scripts.
- **Validate `crontab` syntax** and permissions regularly.

---

## ✅ 6. Backup & Recovery

- **Automate regular backups** using `rsync`, `tar`, or snapshot tools.
- **Test restore procedures** periodically.
- **Keep a rescue ISO or recovery mode access plan**.
- **Use `etckeeper`** to track changes in `/etc`.

---

## ✅ 7. Networking

- **Use `ip` instead of deprecated `ifconfig`**.
- **Keep `/etc/hosts` and DNS settings clean**.
- **Monitor network usage and traffic** with `nload`, `iftop`, `vnstat`.

---

## ✅ 8. Logging & Monitoring

- **Centralize logs** using syslog, rsyslog, or Fluentd.
- **Use `journalctl` and `logrotate`** effectively.
- **Set alerts for disk space, load, CPU, and failed services**.

---

## ✅ 9. Compliance & Auditability

- **Enforce password policies** via PAM or `login.defs`.
- **Enable audit logging** (`auditd`) for sensitive actions.
- **Review user and group permissions** regularly.

---

## ✅ 10. Documentation & Change Control

- **Document configurations** in version control (e.g., Git).
- **Use infrastructure as code** for repeatable environments.
- **Log every production change** with a rollback plan.

---

✅ These practices help ensure Linux systems are **secure, maintainable, observable, and performant** in production environments.
