# SRE and DevOps Anti-Patterns

This document outlines common anti-patterns in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps, along with explanations and recommended practices to avoid them. These anti-patterns often lead to system fragility, team burnout, and operational inefficiencies.

---

## 1. Manual Deployments

- **Problem:** Deployments are triggered manually via scripts or console commands.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Prone to human error, inconsistency, and lack of repeatability.
- **Solution:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate and standardize deployments.

---

## 2. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

- **Problem:** A single component failure brings down the whole system.
- **Why It’s Bad:** High risk of outages and poor system resilience.
- **Solution:** Design systems with redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing.

---

## 3. Alert Fatigue

- **Problem:** Teams are bombarded with too many alerts, most of which are non-actionable.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Critical alerts get missed; team morale drops.
- **Solution:** Tune alerts, set proper thresholds, and use alert deduplication and suppression.

---

## 4. Lack of Observability

- **Problem:** Systems lack meaningful metrics, logs, or traces.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Root cause analysis and performance tuning become difficult.
- **Solution:** Use observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and Jaeger to build visibility.

---

## 5. Hero Culture

- **Problem:** A few individuals are relied on to fix all issues.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Leads to burnout and creates single points of human failure.
- **Solution:** Promote knowledge sharing, documentation, and rotation of on-call duties.

---

## 6. Blame-Oriented Postmortems

- **Problem:** Post-incident reviews focus on blaming individuals.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Stifles learning and creates fear-driven culture.
- **Solution:** Conduct blameless postmortems focused on systems and process improvements.

---

## 7. Ignoring Toil

- **Problem:** Repetitive manual tasks are accepted as normal.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Wastes time, causes burnout, and hinders innovation.
- **Solution:** Continuously identify and automate toil using scripts, bots, and tools.

---

## 8. Overengineering Monitoring

- **Problem:** Too many dashboards and metrics that are rarely used or understood.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Increases cognitive load and obscures useful signals.
- **Solution:** Focus on key Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and meaningful visualizations.

---

## 9. Lack of Capacity Planning

- **Problem:** Systems are not tested or reviewed for expected traffic or load.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Can result in outages or unnecessary overprovisioning.
- **Solution:** Regularly review capacity needs, simulate traffic, and implement autoscaling.

---

## 10. No Runbooks or Playbooks

- **Problem:** No predefined steps exist for incident handling or common operations.
- **Why It’s Bad:** Delays response time and causes inconsistent resolutions.
- **Solution:** Document common procedures, escalation paths, and resolutions as runbooks/playbooks.

## Summary

Avoiding these anti-patterns helps improve system reliability, reduce burnout, and enable scalable and efficient DevOps practices. SRE and DevOps are cultural as well as technical transformations—focus on continuous improvement and automation.
