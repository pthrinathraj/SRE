# 🔐 TCP Handshake vs TLS Handshake – Explained

This document provides a **detailed comparison** between the **TCP handshake** and the **TLS handshake**, explaining how they work, how they differ, and how they work together to enable secure, reliable communication over the internet.

## 🌐 What is TCP?

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is a transport-layer protocol that enables reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

Before any data is transmitted, **a TCP connection must be established using a 3-way handshake**.

---

## 🔁 TCP 3-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment)

### 🔧 Steps:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**: Client sends a TCP SYN packet to initiate a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge the request and send its own sequence number.
3. **ACK**: Client sends an ACK back to confirm the connection.

CLIENT                                 SERVER        
  | -------- SYN (SEQ=X) -----------> |      
  | <------ SYN-ACK (SEQ=Y, ACK=X+1) |     
  | --------- ACK (ACK=Y+1) --------> |      


✅ After this, the TCP connection is **established** and ready for data transmission.

## 🔐 What is TLS?

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol that provides **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication** over a TCP connection.

TLS is **not a replacement for TCP** — it **sits on top of TCP** and ensures that the data transmitted is **secure**.

## 🔐 TLS 1.2 Handshake – Step-by-Step

1. **Client Hello**
   - Client sends supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and a random value.

2. **Server Hello**
   - Server responds with its chosen TLS version, cipher suite, and certificate.

3. **Certificate Validation**
   - Client verifies the server’s certificate (via trusted CA, expiration, domain match).

4. **Key Exchange**
   - Client generates a pre-master key and sends it encrypted using the server’s public key.
   - Both client and server derive the same session key.

5. **Finished**
   - Both parties send a “Finished” message to verify the handshake and begin secure communication.

CLIENT                                SERVER           
  | ---- ClientHello ---------------> |        
  | <----- ServerHello -------------- |        
  | <----- Certificate -------------- |        
  | ---- Key Exchange + Finished ---> |        
  | <------------ Finished ---------- |

## 🔄 Relationship Between TCP and TLS

| Layer | Protocol | Purpose                            |
|-------|----------|------------------------------------|
| 7     | HTTP     | Application logic (e.g., web content) |
| 6     | TLS/SSL  | Encryption, authentication         |
| 4     | TCP      | Reliable connection & ordering     |
| 3     | IP       | Packet routing                     |

➡️ **TLS depends on TCP**, but TCP doesn’t require TLS.

## 🧪 Key Differences

| Feature            | **TCP Handshake**                     | **TLS Handshake**                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Establishes a reliable connection      | Establishes a secure, encrypted session            |
| **Layer**           | Transport (Layer 4)                    | Application (Layer 7, over TCP)                    |
| **Encryption**      | ❌ Not encrypted                       | ✅ Enables encryption after handshake              |
| **Authentication**  | ❌ No authentication                  | ✅ Server identity verified via certificate        |
| **Key Exchange**    | ❌ None                               | ✅ Yes – Shared secret derived                    |
| **Message Count**   | 3 messages                            | 4+ (TLS 1.2), fewer in TLS 1.3                     |
| **Common Usage**    | All TCP apps (HTTP, FTP, SSH)         | HTTPS, SMTPS, FTPS, etc.                           |

## 🧠 Why They Are Both Needed

- **TCP** ensures the **connection is reliable** (no dropped or out-of-order packets).
- **TLS** ensures the **data is secure** (encrypted, authenticated, and tamper-proof).

Together, they form the foundation of secure communication protocols like **HTTPS**.

---

## 💡 Real-World Example: HTTPS

When you visit `https://example.com`:

1. Your browser initiates a **TCP handshake** with the server.
2. Once connected, a **TLS handshake** secures the session.
3. Encrypted **HTTP requests/responses** flow over the TLS-secured TCP channel.

## 🔍 Related Terms

- **SSL**: Predecessor to TLS. Obsolete and insecure.
- **TLS 1.3**: Latest version of TLS, offering faster handshakes and stronger security.
- **SNI**: Server Name Indication – allows multiple TLS certificates on the same IP address.
- **CA**: Certificate Authority – issues and signs server certificates for identity verification.
