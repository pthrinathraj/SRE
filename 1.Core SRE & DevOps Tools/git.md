# üß± Section A: Git

## ‚úÖ 1. Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on code in a non-linear workflow. Git is the backbone of modern software development and a foundational tool for DevOps and SRE practices.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Key Components

- **Repository** ‚Äì A project folder initialized with Git tracking.
- **Commit** ‚Äì A snapshot of staged changes.
- **Branch** ‚Äì A separate line of development.
- **Merge** ‚Äì Integrates changes from one branch to another.
- **Remote** ‚Äì A version of the project hosted on another system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Index (Staging Area)** ‚Äì Where changes are prepared before committing.
- **HEAD** ‚Äì Pointer to the current branch reference.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a new Git repository. |
| `git clone <url>` | Clone a repository from a remote. |
| `git status` | Show the working tree status. |
| `git add <file>` | Stage changes for commit. |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Commit staged changes. |
| `git log` | View commit history. |
| `git diff` | Show changes between commits or working directory. |
| `git branch` | List, create, or delete branches. |
| `git checkout <branch>` | Switch branches or restore files. |
| `git merge <branch>` | Merge a branch into the current one. |
| `git pull` | Fetch and integrate from remote. |
| `git push` | Upload local commits to remote. |

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Pros & Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- Distributed and highly available
- Branching and merging are fast and reliable
- Powerful tooling and integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Large community and support ecosystem
- Enables CI/CD pipelines and GitOps

### ‚ùå Cons:
- Can be confusing for beginners (merge conflicts, rebases)

Enable branch protection rules: no force pushes, require PRs, signed commits, etc.

---

### ‚úÖ 24. What is a rebase interactive (`-i`) used for?

‚úÖ Next: Section C ‚Äì Best Practices & Considerations for Git

# üß± Section C: Git ‚Äì Best Practices & Considerations

This section outlines best practices for using Git effectively and safely in team environments, especially relevant for DevOps, SREs, and developers managing production-grade infrastructure or codebases.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. General Best Practices

- **Commit often** with meaningful messages.
- **Use feature branches** for new work instead of committing directly to `main`.
- **Keep branches short-lived** to reduce merge conflicts.
- **Use `.gitignore` wisely** to prevent committing temporary or sensitive files.
- **Don‚Äôt commit secrets or credentials**. Use environment variables or secret managers.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Commit Message Guidelines

- Follow a standard format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short description>
  
  [Optional body: detailed explanation]
  ```
- Use types like `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`.
- Keep the summary line under 50 characters.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Merging & Rebasing

- Prefer **fast-forward merges** for simple changes.
- Use **merge commits** for feature integration and clarity in history.
- **Avoid rebasing shared branches**.
- **Squash commits** for clean history before merging PRs.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Collaboration & Remotes

- **Pull before you push** to minimize conflicts.
- **Review code before merging** using Pull Requests or Merge Requests.
- **Use protected branches** to enforce quality checks like CI/CD and reviews.
- **Sync your fork regularly** with upstream repositories.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Large Repositories & Performance

- Use **shallow clones** for CI/CD if full history isn‚Äôt needed.
- Run `git gc` and `git prune` periodically.
- Avoid tracking large binary files; use Git LFS if necessary.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Safety & Recovery

- Enable `git rerere` to help with repeated conflict resolution.
- Use `reflog` to recover lost commits or branches.
- Test history-rewriting commands (`reset`, `rebase`, `filter-branch`) in non-production environments.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Automation & Hooks

- Leverage **Git hooks** to enforce commit message format, run linters/tests, or validate files.
- Use `pre-push` hooks to prevent pushing broken or large code.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Tagging & Releases

- Use **annotated tags** for production releases:
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"
  ```
- Push tags explicitly:
  ```bash
  git push origin --tags
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Working in Teams

- Establish a **branching strategy** (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based).
- Enforce **CI/CD pipelines** on every merge/push.
- Document your Git workflow for onboarding and collaboration.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Security & Compliance

- Never store secrets in Git. Use `.gitignore` and secret scanners.
- Periodically audit repos for sensitive data using tools like `git-secrets`.
- Consider signed commits and tags (`git commit -S`, `git tag -s`) for trust and verification.

---

‚úÖ These practices help ensure Git usage is secure, efficient, and team-friendly.
