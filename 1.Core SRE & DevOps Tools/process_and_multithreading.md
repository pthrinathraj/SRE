# 🧠 Linux Process Management and Context Switching

This document provides a comprehensive overview of **processes** in Linux, covering their lifecycle, attributes, states, creation, termination, scheduling, synchronization, IPC, and context switching.

## 🔹 What is a Process?
A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. It includes:
- Program code
- Current activity (e.g., program counter, registers)
- Stack and heap memory
- Open files and signals
- One or more **threads** of execution

## 🔹 Components of a Process
- **Program Code**
- **Memory Layout**:
  - Text Segment
  - Data Segment
  - Heap
  - Stack
- **Process Control Block (PCB)**:
  - PID
  - Process state
  - Program counter
  - CPU registers
  - Memory management data
  - I/O and accounting info

## 🔹 Process States
- **New**
- **Ready**
- **Running**
- **Waiting**
- **Terminated**

### Linux-specific states:
- R: Running or ready to run
- S: Interruptible sleep
- D: Uninterruptible sleep
- T: Stopped
- Z: Zombie

## 🔹 Process Attributes
- PID, PPID, UID/GID, State, Priority, Command

## 🔹 Process Scheduling
- **Algorithms**: FCFS, SJN, Round Robin, Priority, Multilevel Queue
- **Linux Scheduler**: CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)
- **Policies**:
  - SCHED_OTHER
  - SCHED_FIFO
  - SCHED_RR

## 🔹 Process Lifecycle
### 1. Creation
- `fork()` – Duplicates parent
- `exec()` – Replaces memory with a new program
- `clone()` – Fine-grained sharing for threads

### 2. Kernel Task States
- TASK_RUNNING
- TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
- TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
- TASK_STOPPED
- TASK_TRACED
- TASK_ZOMBIE
- TASK_DEAD

### 3. Termination
- Normal: `exit()`
- Signal: `kill -SIGTERM`
- Abnormal: Error/Crash
- Cleanup: `wait()` or `waitpid()`

### 4. Reaping
- Zombies: Reaped using `wait()`/`waitpid()`
- Orphan zombies adopted by `init` (PID 1)

## 🔹 Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Pipes
- FIFOs (Named Pipes)
- Message Queues
- Shared Memory
- Semaphores
- Sockets

## 🔹 Process Synchronization
- Mutexes
- Semaphores
- Monitors

## 🔹 Process vs Thread
| Feature      | Process         | Thread           |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Memory Space | Isolated         | Shared           |
| Overhead     | High             | Low              |
| Isolation    | Full             | Partial          |

## 🔹 Context Switching
**Context Switching** is storing current process state and restoring another’s.

### Components:
- Program Counter
- CPU Registers
- Memory Maps
- PCB

### Overhead:
- CPU cycles
- Cache flush
- System call latency

### Optimization:
- Processor affinity
- Efficient scheduling
- Minimize unnecessary system calls

# 🧵 Multithreading in Programming

## 📌 What is Multithreading?

**Multithreading** is a programming technique that allows multiple threads (independent paths of execution) to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread shares the same memory space but can execute tasks independently, enabling faster and more efficient program execution—especially when handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

- A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
- Threads **share memory**, making inter-thread communication easier but requiring synchronization.
- Multithreading enhances performance in scenarios involving **I/O-bound** or **concurrent** operations.

---

## 📍 Common Use Cases of Multithreading

### 1. **Web Servers and Application Servers**
- Handle multiple client requests at the same time.
- Examples: Apache, Nginx, Tomcat.

### 2. **Gaming Engines**
- Different threads for rendering, sound, physics, and input.

### 3. **Real-Time Systems**
- Embedded systems and OS-level services use threads to manage real-time tasks.

### 4. **Desktop Applications**
- UI responsiveness is improved by offloading background tasks to separate threads.

### 5. **Mobile Applications**
- Network calls and heavy computations run in background threads to prevent UI freezing.

### 6. **Machine Learning / Data Processing**
- Parallel model training, data pre-processing, and tensor operations.

### 7. **Compilers and IDEs**
- Background threads handle tasks like syntax checking, code suggestions, and building projects.

## ✅ Benefits of Multithreading

- 🚀 **Improved performance** for concurrent workloads.
- 🖥️ **Better resource utilization** of CPU cores.
- 🧠 **Responsiveness** in user-facing applications.
- ⏱️ **Faster execution** of multiple tasks.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges in Multithreading

- 🧩 **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads modifying shared data simultaneously.
- 🔒 **Deadlocks**: Threads waiting on each other indefinitely.
- ⛓️ **Thread Synchronization**: Managing access to shared resources.
- 🐞 **Debugging Complexity**: Harder to trace bugs due to concurrent execution paths.

---

## 📚 Summary

Multithreading is a powerful tool that, when used properly, can significantly enhance performance and responsiveness. However, it comes with complexity that must be managed through careful design and synchronization mechanisms.

# 🔍 Process vs Thread in Linux

This document explains the fundamental differences between a **process** and a **thread** in a Linux system.

---

## 🧠 Definitions

- **Process:**  
  An independent program in execution with its own memory space and resources.

- **Thread:**  
  A lightweight unit of execution that runs within a process and shares its memory and resources.

## 📊 Key Differences

| Feature               | 🧩 **Process**                                     | 🧵 **Thread**                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Independent program in execution                   | Lightweight task within a process                          |
| **Memory Space**      | Has its **own** memory space                       | Shares **common** memory space of the process              |
| **Creation**          | Created using `fork()`, `exec()`                   | Created using `pthread_create()` or similar APIs           |
| **Context Switching** | Slower – full context switch                       | Faster – smaller context switch                            |
| **Resource Overhead** | High – needs separate memory and resources         | Low – shares resources with other threads                  |
| **Communication**     | Through IPC (pipes, sockets, shared memory)        | Through shared memory within the process                   |
| **Crash Impact**      | One crashing process does **not** affect others    | One crashing thread can crash the **entire** process       |
| **Use Case**          | Running separate applications                      | Performing parallel tasks in a single app (e.g., UI + I/O) |

## 🔧 Examples in Linux

### Viewing
- **Processes:**  
  Use `ps aux`, `top`, or `pstree`.

- **Threads:**  
  Use `htop`, enable “Show Threads” under settings.

### Creation
- **Processes:**  
  - `fork()`, `exec()` in C/C++  
  - `subprocess` module in Python

- **Threads:**  
  - `pthread` in C/C++  
  - `threading` module in Python

---

## 📌 Summary

- A **process** is a heavyweight unit with isolated memory and resources.
- A **thread** is a lightweight execution path that shares memory with other threads in the same process.
- **Threads are faster and more efficient** for concurrent tasks within the same application.
- **Processes offer better fault isolation** and are ideal for separate applications.
