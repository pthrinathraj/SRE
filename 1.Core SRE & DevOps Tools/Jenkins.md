# 🧱 Section A: Jenkins

## ✅ 1. Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It enables Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), helping teams automate the software development lifecycle. Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins, integrations, and pipelines, making it a go-to choice for DevOps workflows.

---

## ✅ 2. Key Components

- **Job (Build Job)** – A task or pipeline that performs automation (build/test/deploy).
- **Node/Agent** – A machine that runs Jenkins jobs (can be master or slave).
- **Executor** – A computational slot on a node that runs builds.
- **Pipeline** – A series of steps defined as code (`Jenkinsfile`) for CI/CD.
- **Plugin** – Extends Jenkins’ functionality (e.g., Git, Docker, Slack).
- **SCM (Source Code Management)** – Git, SVN, etc., to pull code.
- **Artifact** – Build output stored for later use.

---

## ✅ 3. Common Commands / UI Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Freestyle Job** | Simple jobs with steps defined in the UI. |
| **Pipeline Job** | Scripted or Declarative pipelines defined as code. |
| **Jenkinsfile** | File stored in repo that defines pipeline stages. |
| **Build Now** | Trigger a manual build. |
| **Build Triggers** | Configure when jobs run (e.g., SCM poll, webhook). |
| **Post-build Actions** | Archive artifacts, email notifications, etc. |
| **Credentials** | Securely store secrets and tokens. |
| **Console Output** | Shows real-time job logs. |
| **Blue Ocean** | Modern UI for pipeline visualization. |

---

## ✅ 4. Pros & Cons

### ✅ Pros:
- Highly extensible with 1800+ plugins
